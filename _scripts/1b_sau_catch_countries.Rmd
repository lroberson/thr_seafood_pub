## Summary

Country totals for catch by volume and value 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(pracma)

```

## species catch by country

SAU data is available upon request from seaaroundus.org

The provided subset contains:

catch tonnage and value by country and taxon
years: 2006 - 2014
fishing sector: industrial
reporting type: reported
*Red List category (from version 2019.2)

```{thr catch by country}

sau_catch <- fread("_data/sau_catch_pub.csv")
names(sau_catch)

## some wrangling
unique(sau_catch$redlist_category)
sau_catch$redlist_category <- fct_collapse(sau_catch$redlist_category, LR = c("LR_NT","LR_LC"))

## Number of thr species per country

n_catch_spp <- sau_catch %>%
  group_by(fishing_entity) %>%
  mutate(n_spp_catch = n_distinct(taxon_sciname)) %>%
  filter(redlist_category %in% c("CR","EN","VU")) %>%
  group_by(fishing_entity, n_spp_catch) %>%
  summarise(n_thr_spp_catch = n_distinct(taxon_sciname)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_thr_spp_catch)) %>%
  ungroup()

n_distinct(n_catch_spp$fishing_entity) 


## any countries that don't catch threatened species?

catch_countries <- sau_catch %>%
  group_by(fishing_entity) %>%
  summarise(tot_catch = sum(catch_recons)) %>%
  ungroup()

no_thr <- anti_join(catch_countries, n_catch_spp, by = "fishing_entity") 


## means

n_catch_spp %>% summarise(avg = mean(n_thr_spp_catch)) 

n_catch_spp %>% 
  filter(n_thr_spp_catch > 0) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(fishing_entity)) 

write_csv(n_catch_spp, "_results/n_spp_catch_bycountry.csv")

```

## WMAs catch per country

```{wmas country catch}

library(pracma) # for weighted moving average

names(sau_catch)

## catch volume and value per country

wma_catch_countries <- sau_catch %>% 
  group_by(fishing_entity, year, record_cat) %>%
  summarise(catch = sum(catch_recons),
            value = sum(value_econom)) %>%
  ungroup()

print(object.size(wma_catch_countries), units = "Mb") 

write_csv(wma_catch_countries, "_results/wma_catch_countries.csv")

```

## country totals for ms

for 2014 wmas

```{total for ms}

wmas <- read_csv("_results/wma_catch_countries.csv")
