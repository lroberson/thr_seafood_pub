This species is typically caught by trolling, hook and line and as a bycatch in purse-seine and longline fisheries (Collette 1995).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific, this species is often caught as bycatch in purse seines, especially given the increased effort using Fish Aggregating Devices (FADS). No stock assessment has been carried out. In the Atlantic, small tunas are exploited mainly by coastal fisheries and often by artisanal fisheries, although substantial catches are also made, either as target species or as bycatch, by purse seiners, mid-water trawlers, handlines, troll lines, driftnets, surface drifting long-lines and small scale gillnets. Several recreational fisheries also target small tunas. In the southwest Atlantic this species is caught by artisanal handline and trolling in the northeast and central Brazil, as bycatch in industrial longliners and game fisheries (Nobrega <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009, Amorim and Silva 2005).<br/><br/>Increasing using of FADs, both fixed and those used in the tropical tuna purse seine fishery, has increased the directed and bycatch mortality of Wahoo throughout its range.

It is important to note that variability in catches might be more related to reporting rate than to actual fluctuations in the population (Hazin pers. comm. 2010).

Stock enhancement program of <em>A. schlegelii</em> was initiated when annual landings dropped below 200 tonnes. The number of&#160;<em>A.&#160;</em><em>schlegelii&#160;</em>juveniles released in 1996 exceeded nine million, representing the third main species stocked in Japan, with almost 1.4 million of the juveniles released into Hiroshima bay (Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Around six million fingerlings are artificially stocked annually in Japan (Fushimi 2001).&#160;More than one million juveniles were released each year between 1985 and 1996. Subsequently, total harvest increased to &gt;200 tonnes per year and Hiroshima Bay is now the primary fishing ground for this species in Japan, accounting for 10% of total domestic landings. More than half of the <em>A. schlegelii</em>&#160;population is caught in the Seto Inland Sea with Hiroshima Bay (Blanco-Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;After the Hiroshima Bay stock enhancement in the early 1980s, data suggest that the combined effects of releases of cultured juveniles and reduced fishing effort resulted in reduced size-at-age in black sea bream due to density-dependent processes. Further support for the hypothesis that the carrying capacity for black sea bream was exceeded in 2000 comes from the sex ratio. It appears that by 2000, many of the released fish, and those no longer as vulnerable to capture due to lower fishing effort, had matured as females (Blanco-Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<br/><br/>In Hiroshima Prefecture, western Japan, the catch of black sea bream accounted for 15% of the total black sea bream catch in Japan. Hiroshima Bay is known as the main fishing ground with 60% of the catch in the prefecture.

However, overall landings decreasing in Japan (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009).&#160;The increase in population of this species from catch is largely due to stocking in Taiwan (Liao pers. comm. 2009).&#160;In 1982 and 1983, prior to the intensive stocking, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) in Hiroshima Bay remained low but in 1999 and 2000, the CPUE increased 10-fold (Blanco-Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>FAO capture production in Taiwan for the&#160;<em>A. schlegelii</em>&#160;show an increase from 1998 to 2007, from 604 tonnes with a peak in 2001 of 878 tonnes and 602 tonnes in 2007.

The majority of surgeonfishes are exclusively found on coral reef habitat, and of these, approximately 80% are experiencing a greater than 30% loss of coral reef area and degradation of coral reef habitat quality across their distributions. However, more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of coral reef habitat loss and degradation on these species' populations. Widespread coral reef loss and declining habitat conditions are particularly worrying for species that recruit into areas with live coral cover, especially as studies have shown that protection of pristine habitats facilitate the persistence of adult populations in species that have spatially separated adult and juvenile habitats (Comeros-Raynal <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2012).",There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species.

The Caspian basin lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s, mainly due to the construction of hydroelectric power stations; the Ural is now the only river in the basin with unregulated flow. Flow regulation of the Kuban River has led to the loss of 140,000 ha, and damming of the river Don has removed 68,000 ha spawning ground. For example, in the Yugoslavian section of the Danube, the annual catch dropped from 14,636 kg in 1983 to 1,636 kg in 1985 (a decline of just under 90%), this is believed to be due to the construction of the Djerdap (Irongate) II dam which was constructed in 1984, leaving no accessible spawning grounds for the species in the upstream reaches and in former Yugoslavia (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Poaching and illegal fishing, which appears to be increasing, is also a threat to the species. Enforcement of legislation regulating the fishery for the species appear to be lacking. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species (in both marine and freshwater).<br/><br/>High levels of pollution (from oil and industrial waste), in both the Black and Caspian Sea basins have altered hormonal balance, and increased the number of hermaphroditic fish. Pollution levels are now decreasing since the break up of the Soviet Union (Levin, 1977 in CITES 2000). In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>Genetic pollution is also a potential threat as stocks are moved to different locations (e.g. Caspian stocks moved to Sea of Azov).<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.","Restocking measures are ongoing, however stocks are continuing to decline. In the early 1990s, between 30-55% of the Caspian stock reportedly originated from hatcheries (Barannikova 1995 in CITES 2000, Khodorevskaya <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2000).

Overall, however, enforcement measures seem to be lacking. Fish lifts and artificial spawning grounds have been introduced to parts of the Caspian region (CITES 2000) without much success. This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998.<br/><br/>Gene bank of live specimens and cryopreservation is ongoing in Russia and Iran.",Decreasing,"The species wild native population has undergone major decline which is currently occurring. But due to the large levels of stocking (particularly Russia and Iran) the exact levels are unknown. According to CITES (2000) Russia released 25 million fingerlings into the Vologa between 1979-80, 35 million between 1981-85, 40.8 million between 1986-90, 42 million between 1991-95 and 28 million 1996-98; Iran released 300,000 fingerlings in 1994 which has risen nearly every year to 960,000 in 1999.<br/><br/>Despite this level of stocking, fisheries catches have fallen, particularly from the early 1990s in the Caspian. According to FAO fisheries statistics (FAO 2009) global catches fell from 4,250 tonnes in 1992 (first available catch data) to 67 tonnes in 2007 (last available catch data), a decline of 98% in 15 years. The average catch from 1992-1999 (8 year period) was 1,531.75 tonnes, whereas the average catch from 2000-2007 (8 year period) was 175.37 tonnes, a decline of 88.5%.<br/><br/>Data from the Caspian Sea (Khodorevskaya <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009) shows similar declines: catches were between 6,000 and 9,000 tonnes per year in the 1960s to a peak of around 14,500 tonnes in the late 1970s early 1980s to less than 1,000 per year from 2000 to 2008. The estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga has also drastically declined, from 13,200 tonnes (1961-65) and 22,200 tonnes (1966-70) to 1,000 tonnes (1996-97) and 1,000 tonnes (1998-2002).

In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Single specimens of Stellate Sturgeon were harvested at the Azerbaijan coast during a trawl survey in 1994; this is most likely due to heavy illegal fishing (large number of poaching gears were observed).<br/><br/>Overfishing has prevented hatcheries catching enough mature individuals to maintain the necessary broodstock (Artyukhin 1997 in CITES 2000), and stocking has severely decreased in the Caspian Sea as the stocking process relies upon wild individuals (unlike other sturgeon species they are difficult to keep mature individuals in ponds, Nikolai pers. comm.). The annual release (over the past 10 years) of sturgeon juveniles from sturgeon hatcheries in Russia amounts to from 3 to 20 million specimens; in Kazakhstan - from 2.5 to 4.1 million specimens; in Azerbaijan - from 2.5 to 6.8 million specimens; in Islamic Republic of Iran - from 0.2 to 1.3 million specimens. This quantity of stocks recruitment of Stellate Sturgeon from industrial sturgeon culture is not enough to supply the population at an optimum level&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Dams have also led to the loss of many spawning grounds. For example the Volgograd dam (built in 1955) led to loss of 40% of spawning sites formally available in the Volga (Khodorevskaya <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009). The species is also considered extirpated from the upper and middle Danube since the building of the Djerdap Dams (Iron Gate Dams). The Don River dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban led to the loss of 140,000 ha of spawning grounds.<br/><br/>Pollution is a threat to the species. In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species (Gessner, J. pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Introduced Mnemiopsis (from US) which impacts the species food source (pelagic fishes) has impacted the Black Sea population (impacts now reduced in Black Sea) and is now impacting the Caspian Sea populations.<br/><br/>Introduction of fertilized eggs (from before 1986 and again 2003/4, and it may continue) from the Caspian Sea into the Azov Sea may impact the genetic integrity of Azov Sea population (Chebanov pers. comm.).","Restocking measures are ongoing. However, although aquaculture contributes considerably to the maintenance of the stocks, it cannot compensate for the damage caused to natural reproduction by overfishing (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>It is not fully protected in any range state apart from Moldova. A licence is required for fishing in most countries and private sturgeon fisheries are banned in Iran. This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998.<br/><br/>According to 2007 Caspian Sea Bioresource Commission, 8.1 million fingerlings of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">A. stellatus</span> were released into Caspian Sea by Khazakstan, Iran and Azerbaijan. Russia released 45 million (all sturgeon species) in 2007, but not specified how many were <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">A. stellatus</span> - but this is not less than 12 million (Ruban pers. comm.). <br/><br/>To preserve the commercial importance of Stellate Sturgeon population it is necessary to protect the recruitment from natural spawning and increase the industrial sturgeon aquaculture. Considering the state of stocks of the Caspian Sea it is necessary for all Caspian Sea states to suspend its harvest for commercial purposes (in Russia, the ban on Stellate Sturgeon commercial harvesting has been introduced since 2005). <br/><br/>Stellate Sturgeon has no commercial value in the basins of the Black and Azov Seas.",Decreasing,"In the early 1990s it was estimated that nearly 100% of the Sea of Azov population and 30% of the Caspian Sea population were from stocking. Recent estimations are that more than 50% of the Caspian Sea populations are from stocking (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Global catches show that in 1992, 2,730 tonnes were caught, falling to a low of 38 tonnes in 2004, and 50 tonnes in 2007 (a decline of over 98% in 15 years). The average catch between 1992-1999 was 1,063 tonnes, and between 2000 and 2007 it was 132 tonnes, a decline of 87% (FAO 2009). The decline in commercial catch for the species is believed to reflect a decline in the species population (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>For the whole Caspian basin, catch peaked in 1977 with 13,700 tonnes; this has shown an almost continuous decline to 305 tonnes in 2003 (most recent data) (over 97% decline in 32 years) (Pikitch <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). In 2008 the agreed catch quota for <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">A.stellatus</span> for all Caspian Sea countries in 2008 was set at 240 tonnes, including commercial and scientific catch; the quota has not been met (Pourkazemi pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Khodorevskaya <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. (2009) shows that the average numbers of spawners entering the lower Volga per year has fallen from a peak of 230,000 (between 1986-90) to just 50,000 (between 1998-2002), a decline of 78%. It is expected that the decline has continued at a similar rate to the present time (though data does not exist) and will continue. In the Ural the estimated number of migrating individuals per year has also shown a decline, in 1970: 1,100,000; 1979: 1,050,000; 1990: 300,000 migrating individuals (Veschev 1995); 1998: 103,600; 2001: 87,400 (Pikitch <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2000). This shows a 92% decline from 1979 to 2001 (also from 1970 to 2001, as migrating individuals per year remained relatively stable between 1970 and 1979).<br/><br/>Distribution of Stellate Sturgeon in the Caspian Sea has declined (based on CPUE distribution data) from the 1970s to 2004 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009).<br/><br/>In summer, Stellate Sturgeon feed in the warmer waters, forming the densest concentration, more than 0.6 specimens per 10,000 m<sup>3</sup> in the western region of the Caspian sea; this is four times higher than was recorded in 1994 (Khodorevskaya <em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). Concentration of all species of sturgeons and in particular, of Stellate Sturgeon, remains high in the area off the island of Ogurchinskii in the southern part of the Caspian Sea off the Turkmenian coast, but its abundance has declined 3.4 times compared to 1991&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The total population size in the investigated water in 2008 was between 6.7-9.5 million specimens, this has fallen from 83 million in 1988&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Over recent decades, Stellate Sturgeon abundance in the Caspian Sea has reduced. Evidence of this is shown in the decrease of the average catch per unit effort during trawl surveys between 1978-1999. These showed a three-fold decrease in the northern Caspian Sea, a 2.7-fold decline in the middle part of the Caspian Sea and a six-fold decline off the Dagestan coast (Vlasenko <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2003). Decrease of CPUE has been more apparent in the southern part of the sea. The Stellate Sturgeon population has declined from 69.7 million specimens in 1978 to 15.6 million in 2002, and 7.6 million specimens in 2008. Commercial stock decreased by 12 times during this period&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In the Black Sea, in Romania, from 2002-2005 the catches of wild individuals (stocking only started in 2006 in the Danube) dropped from 12.427 tonnes to 3.43 tonnes (72.5% in 4 years); in 2006 commercial catch was stopped (Suciu pers comm.).

Rhodes unpublished data 2016).&#160;During a 12-month market survey in Chuuk (Micronesia), it was not in the top 50 species captured in the mixed-gear fishery. The species represented 0.028% of the total reef fish sampled in Chuuk, with 16% taken by hook-and-line fishing and 84% by spear. Approximately 25% of landings were considered immature (Cuetos-Bueno and Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).<em>&#160;<br/></em><br/>A wet market survey conducted in Hong Kong from November 2004 to January 2006, recorded only 16 individuals of this species (To 2009), but a more recent survey in Hong Kong wet market and restaurants from mid-November 2012 to mid-March 2013, recorded 110 individuals, with 100% estimated to be immature (Lam 2013).&#160;Based on 10-15 years of underwater and market observation at a very limited locality in Taiwan, this species is regarded as “rare” (K-T.

Nevertheless its small litter size, schooling behaviour, inshore habitat and hence availability to a wide variety of inshore fishing gear (beach seine, gillnet, purse seine, benthic longline, trawl etc.), its marketability and the generally intense and unregulated nature of inshore fisheries across large parts of the species' range warrant a global listing of Near Threatened, and a Vulnerable listing in Southeast Asia where fishing pressure is particularly intense and the species is a common component of landings. With further data it will likely fall into a threatened category in other regions also. <br/> <br/>This species occurs in coastal inshore waters where fishing pressure is typically very heavy, especially in SE Asian waters, in parts of Africa and through portions of the species' range in the Americas. The strong swimming nature of this species makes it quite susceptible to a range of fisheries, especially inshore gill net fisheries, which are extremely intensive in some regions (for example, Kalimantan in Indonesia). The species also enters estuarine waters where fishing pressure is also extremely high and where (in SE Asia at least) pollution is also a major factor for all marine life.  <br/> <br/>The species is likely to contribute substantially to numerous inshore artisanal fisheries across its range and it is known to be landed regularly in some places. In Southeast Asia, <em>Aetobatus narinari</em> is landed in most countries within its range, for example, Indonesia (W. White unpublished data), Thailand (Vidthayanon 2002), the Philippines (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005), Taiwan (W. White and P. Kyne pers. obs.) and Malaysia (Manjaji 2002), all of which are countries where fishing pressure on the inshore environment is intense and generally unregulated. In Indonesia the species is presently caught consistently but in only small numbers in many fisheries (W. White unpublished data) and expected future declines in SE Asia are the basis for the Vulnerable listing there. The species is probably widely utilized across its range (Compagno and Last 1999) due to its availability to fisheries. Fishing pressure on the inshore environment across most of the species' range is only likely to increase in the future. <br/> <br/>Off eastern Africa, it is commonly caught by artisanal fishermen, in bottom set gillnets, trawls and longlines in Tanzania (Bianchi 1985), by artisanal gillnet fisheries off northern Madagascar (Doukakis and Jonahson 2003, Robinson in prep.) and by hook and line and harpoon off Somalia (Sommer <em>et al</em>. 1996). <br/> <br/>Although specific details are not available, pressure on the inshore environment through artisanal fishing activities off West Africa, throughout the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and in large portions of the species' American range has likely affecting this species. There is nothing to suggest that pressure will decrease in these regions in the future. <br/> <br/>In South Africa, between 1981 and 2000 there was a non-significant increasing trend in catch of <em>A. narinari</em> in the protective shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal (Young 2001). Of the mean annual catch of 16 animals, 82% were released alive. The species contributed 4.6% to the total batoid catch. Aetobatus narinari is taken in small numbers as bycatch in a shallow water prawn trawl fishery that operates off central KwaZulu-Natal (Fennessy 1994). <br/> <br/>It is a popular public aquarium species and is collected for the marine aquarium trade. In some localities it is likely to be persecuted when considered a pest of mollusc aquaculture farms, as has occurred with other myliobatid species, for example <em>Myliobatis californicus</em> (Gray <em>et al</em>. 1997). <br/> <br/>In a few parts of its range the species faces lower levels of threat. These include South Africa where catch levels are low, the USA where the species is protected in Florida (see Conservation Measures below), the Maldives where the exportation of ray product is banned, parts of Oceania where human populations are low, and Australia. The species is afforded some protection and impact reduction in parts of Australia in Marine Protected Areas, by the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in prawn trawl fisheries and because of spiritual significance in some indigenous communities (see Conservation Measures). However, there is still concern for the species in Australia where it is taken as bycatch in inshore net fisheries and marketed as ?skate wings?, ?ray flaps? or ?eagle ray flaps?. Eagle ray is becoming an increasingly popular seafood product in Australia and the landing of this product is likely to increase in the future.","Fisheries taking <em>A. narinari</em> are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species' range. Attempts to monitor and regulate fisheries in these regions would greatly improve conservation of this and other chondrichthyans. Monitoring (including species-specific catch details) of any directed elasmobranch landings and bycatch are necessary to provide valuable information on the population status of these rays. Fishery-independent surveys of this and other elasmobranchs are necessary to provide estimates of abundance and biomass. <br/> <br/>In addition to species-specific catch details, life history information including age, growth, longevity, movement patterns, habitat use, potential nursery areas, diet, and further reproductive studies are necessary to develop effective conservation actions for <em>A. narinari</em>. Direct estimates of fishing and natural mortality are critical for assessing fisheries impacts on a particular species. <br/> <br/>Of highest priority is the resolution of taxonomic issues to better define the actual ranges of the various forms/species of the <em>A. narinari</em> species-complex. <br/> <br/>A recent reduction in the number of protective shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, will help to limit catches in that region. The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes <em>A. narinari</em>. <br/> <br/>This species is protected in Florida State waters under the Florida Adminstrative Code, with the purpose of increasing public awareness of the need for extensive conservation action. As such, the spotted eagle ray cannot be harvested, possessed, landed, purchased, sold or exchanged in Florida. <br/> <br/>The species is afforded protection on the east coast of Australia in the extensive Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (although only a third of the park is closed to commercial fishing) and the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) in prawn trawl fisheries across northern Australia is mandatory. TEDs are likely to decrease the catch of at least large individuals, as was shown for numerous batoid species by Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. (2002). The spiritual significance of these rays to some indigenous communities has limited traditional catches in parts of northern Australia (Puruntatameri <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/> <br/>In the Maldives, the species is afforded protection in marine reserves created around diving sites in recognition of the high value of sharks and rays to tourism (Anderson and Waheed 2001). The Maldives also banned the export of rays in 1995 and the export of ray skins in 1996. Again, this was to protect the tourism resource (Anderson and Waheed 2001). <br/> <br/>The development and implementation of management plans (national and/or regional e.g., under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks: IPOA-Sharks) are required to facilitate the conservation and management of all elasmobranch species. See Anon. (2004) for an update of progress made towards development and implementation of National Plans of Action for countries across the range of <em>A. narinari</em>.",Decreasing,Population structure of the various forms will likely differ and will need to be considered on a species by species basis once taxonomic issues are resolved.,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

Handling time and handling behaviour by anglers, and the presence/absence of predators significantly effect post-release survival. Hook type and hook retention does not affect post-release survival. For bonefish held in live wells, flow-through ambient water is best for post-release survival. &#160; Post-release survival may be negatively correlated with high temperatures.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation are the most significant threats to this species. Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and disruption of prey species dynamics. Disruptions to shallow coastal ecosystems due to climate change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and urbanization.&#160; Increasing water temperatures may also exceed the thermal maximum of bonefishes (36.4–40.6°C) (Murchie <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2001, Polidoro <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2006, Short <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely throughout its range. Globally, between 20% and 35% of mangrove area have been lost since approximately 1980, and mangrove areas are disappearing at the rate of approximately 1% per year (Valiela <em>et al. </em>2001, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2007).&#160; The highest proportion of threatened mangrove species is found along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America. Valiela <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> (2001) estimates that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year. Four of the 10 (40%) mangrove species present along the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia are listed in one of the three threatened categories, and a fifth species, <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Rhizophora samoensis</span>, is listed as Near Threatened (Polidoro <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2010). Since bonefish rely upon habitats of limited extent, they are especially susceptible to habitat loss and degradation, particularly due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often fragmented in nature, exacerbating this issue. As with other coastal species, fragmentation will likely have direct and indirect negative impacts on bonefish.&#160; Therefore, we suspect a habitat loss of at least 20% in the last 35  years (three generation lengths), and infer similar declines in the  population of <em>A. vulpes</em>.","Despite their ecological and economic importance, fishery regulations for bonefish across the Bahamian Archipelago are limited (Danylchuk <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2008). In the Bahamas, the capture of bonefish using nets and the commercial trade of bonefish are prohibited (Bahamas Department of Fisheries 1986). In the Turks and Caicos Islands,&#160; there are no specific regulations (Turks and Caicos Islands Government 1998). In an effort to conserve fish stocks and their habitats, both countries are using marine protected areas in conjunction with existing fisheries regulations to build sustainable fisheries and protect marine biodiversity.&#160; Catch-and-release is commonly practised by recreational anglers with a strong conservation ethic who travel to the region. Research is needed to identify whether unique bonefish stocks occur in the Bahamian Archipelago, since stock mixing could significantly complicate management of the species (Danylchuk <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al. </span>2008). In Belize and Puerto Rico, bonefish are catch-and release-only. In Florida, this species became catch-and-release only in 2011 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). Enforcement is lacking throughout this species' range.<br/><br/>Rising exploitation pressures, rapid human development within this  species' range, and environmental changes in coastal waters suggest that  new information on population dynamics and resource ecology is  critically needed to support fishery management strategies to conserve  this species (Ault<span style=""""font-style: italic;""""> et al. </span>2008).<br/><br/>This species is found in numerous Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)  throughout its range. In Cuba, bonefish habitats and populations are protected by expansive MPAs on the south coast that are used as recreational fishing catch-and-release zones (Adams pers. comm. 2011).",Decreasing,"<p>There are anecdotal reports of decreasing populations in places where recreational fishing is high and/or where fish are netted (Ault <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2008). Bill Curtis, a legendary professional bonefish guide and a member of the 2012 class of IGFA Legendary Captains and Crew, estimated that by the early 2000s, the visible bonefish population had declined 90% compared to the late 1940s (Curtis 2004). Numerous long-time Florida Keys anglers corroborate the declines described by Curtis (2004); causes for the declines are unknown. In other locations where netting has occurred, populations have been eradicated or size distributions have been truncated (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Unit stock and stock sizes remain virtually unknown, and fishery impacts on the region are largely unknown and remain areas for future evaluation. A recent population census in the Florida Keys indicates that the population remained relatively constant from 2003–2005 (Ault <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al. </span>2008). Connectivity and larval transport among subpopulations are not well understood, but genetic research indicates sufficient gene flow to support a single stock.<br/></p><p>Although it is recognized that this species is distributed throughout the Bahamas Archipelago, no formal studies have been conducted to determine their distribution and relative abundance across spatial or temporal scales (Danylchuk <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2008).

The Bigeye Thresher Shark has the lowest intrinsic rebound potential and least resistance to fisheries of the genus.<br/><br/>Thresher shark species (including <em>A. superciliosus</em>) were found to represent at least 2-3% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading center (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Thresher shark fins are generally low value compared to other species because of their low fin ray count (S. Clarke unpubl. data). It is estimated that between 350,000 and 3.9 million thresher sharks (<em>Alopias</em> species) are represented in the shark fin trade each year or, in biomass, 12,000 to 85,000 mt (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006b). These estimates are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than catches of Alopiidae reported to FAO, which since the early-1980s have generally been less than 1,600 tonnes, and around 1,000 mt since 1998 (Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006). Catches of thresher sharks are clearly hugely under reported globally. Although trend data are as a result largely lacking, these fisheries are unlikely to be sustainable. A recent FAO analysis states, """"unless demonstrated otherwise, it is prudent to consider these species as being fully exploited or overexploited globally"""" (Maguire <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><br/>The life history of this species, including a late age at maturity (12-13 years) and very low fecundity (average two pups per litter) (Chen <em>et al.</em> 1997), render it highly vulnerable to overexploitation. <em>Alopias superciliosus</em> has the lowest annual rate of population increase of all thresher sharks and is therefore particularly at risk from depletion in fisheries. Its epipelagic habitat occurs within the range of commercial longline fisheries in which it is readily caught. Caught or formerly caught in the oceanic longline fisheries operated by the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan (Province of China), Spain, the USA, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, and probably other countries. Especially important areas for these fisheries are the northwestern Indian Ocean, western and Central Pacific, eastern North Pacific, and North Atlantic (Compagno 2001). This species is also taken as incidental bycatch in fixed bottom and pelagic gill nets, in trawls, and as a rare catch of anti-shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It has been caught by anglers with sportsfishing gear (rod-and-reel) in the USA, South Africa, and New Zealand, in some instances by anglers targeting swordfish at night (Compagno 2001).<br/><br/>The Bigeye Thresher was formerly a very important component of the Cuban longline fishery, and more recently has been taken in considerable numbers by longliners off the northeastern USA and by gill net vessels off southern California (USA) and the eastern Atlantic (by Spanish vessels), and by longliners off Taiwan (Province of China; where about 220 t per year are landed) (Compagno 2001).<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Atlantic</strong><br/><em>A. superciliosus</em> has been caught incidentally in the northwest and western central Atlantic for about four decades. The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fisheries monitoring of bigeye thresher shark catch is extremely limited because they are an incidentally caught species. In Canada and the U.S., less than 5% of the pelagic longlining fleets are monitored by observers, making it difficult to elucidate reliable trends in abundance from these data. Fisheries monitoring in international waters is even more limited. The pelagic longline fishing grounds for the US fleet extend from the Grand Banks (about 45°N) in the northwest Atlantic to 5-10°S off the South American coast, within which geographical areas of longline fishing are defined for classification (Cortés <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>The northwest and western central Atlantic regional assessment is based on several estimates of trends in abundance from standardized catch rate indices of the U.S. pelagic longline fishery, between 1986-2000, for thresher sharks (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). The analysis is not species-specific but, based on the location of the catches, the majority of threshers in the dataset are most likely bigeye thresher sharks (K. Goldman pers. comm.), and the sample size of threshers in these data is over 20,000. The estimated decline of thresher sharks combined (<em>A. superciliosus</em> and <em>A. vulpinus</em>) is 80% during this fifteen-year time period, which is just over the length of one generation for bigeye threshers (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). An alternative analysis of the same logbook dataset for 1986-2005 that also combined <em>A. vulpinus</em> and <em>A. superciliosus</em>, resulted in an overall decline of 63% (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fishing pressure on thresher sharks began over two decades prior to the start of this time series, thus the estimated declines are not from virgin biomass.<br/><br/>A more recent analysis of <em>Alopias</em> spp. trends from scientific observer data between 1992 and 2005 in the same U.S. pelagic longline fishery found an almost identical instantaneous rate of decline (-0.12 up to the year 2000) as in the logbook analysis (Baum <em>et al.</em> unpublished manuscript). For this nine year period (1992-2000), the decline amounts to 68%, therefore the decline back to when the fishery started in the 1960s (less than three generation period of 51 years) would be much greater. However, because of recent increases in the catch rates in 2004 and 2005, the overall trend from 1992-2005 of -0.024 was non-significant, and would amount to only a 26% decline (Baum <em>et al.</em> unpublished manuscript). Cortés <em>et al.</em> (2007) also conducted an alternative analysis of this same observer dataset for the same time period that also combined <em>A. vulpinus</em> and <em>A. superciliosus</em>. This analysis of the observer dataset showed a trend opposite to that of the logbook analysis, with a 28% increase since 1992. In contrast, the nominal observer series showed a 39% decline and the logbook index for the same time period showed a decrease of 50%. Furthermore the sample size in the observer analysis was much smaller (n=14-84) than that in the logbook analysis (n=112-1292) and thus the trend estimated should be regarded with caution. Cortés <em>et al.</em>'s (2007) observer analysis was restricted to four out of the 11 geographical areas covered by the pelagic longline fishing fleet to keep a balanced statistical design (Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2007). Their full logbook analysis, which showed an overall decline of 63%, had much larger sample sizes and is thus better to estimate trends with more certainty (Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Bigeye Thresher is more biologically vulnerable than the Common Thresher (<em>A. vulpinus</em>), with which it is grouped in the logbook and observer datasets. Given this species' intrinsic rate of population increase is much lower and that fishing pressure on thresher sharks began over two decades prior to the start of these longline time series, the combined analyses may underestimate the decline in <em>A. superciliosus</em>. The area covered by the dataset analyzed, ranging from the equator to about 50°N, encompasses the confirmed range of bigeye threshers in these two regions (Compagno 2001).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>This species is a bycatch of the semi-industrial fisheries (swordfish and other pelagic fisheries) of southern Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Sicily and Malta, and of artisanal trammel and gillnet fisheries elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea (Bauchot 1987). However, <em>A. superciliosus</em> has been poorly documented in the Mediterranean and is considered scarce or rare (Barrull and Mate 2002). As a result, no data are available on catch trends for this species in the region. In recent years, increasing numbers of new records from the eastern Mediterranean (sometimes multiple captures) demonstrate that this species also penetrates widely to the east of Malta, occurring in the waters off Israel (Levantine basin), in the Aegean Sea off Turkey and southern Greece, and off southern Crete (I. Fergusson pers. obs., Golani 1996, Clò <em>et al.</em> 2005, Clò <em>et al.</em> 2008). Evidence from offshore pelagic fisheries in southern Sicily and Malta indicate that <em>A. superciliosus</em> is caught in unknown numbers each year, but routinely discarded at sea (hence the vernacular name """"False Thresher"""", because of a perceived low local value). Despite the apparent threat posed by bycatch and the species' vulnerable life-history characteristics, there is a lack of records and further information on the population of <em>A. superciliosus</em> in the Mediterranean Sea is required. <br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central Pacific</strong><br/>The California drift gill net fishery for common thresher, <em>A. vulpinus</em> provided strong evidence that thresher sharks are highly vulnerable to rapid population decline when heavily fished, when landings of A. vulpinus declined to 28% of peak landings in 1982 by the late 1980s (Goldman 2005, Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006). Pelagic fleets operating in the eastern central Pacific are known to take <em>A. superciliosus</em>, for example it is a bycatch of the purse seine fishery operating in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Román-Verdesoto and Orozco-Zöller 2005). Ward and Myers (2005) estimated the biomass of thresher sharks to be approximately 5% of the virgin biomass and estimated a decline in abundance of 83% in the eastern tropical Pacific. These estimates were made by a comparison of pelagic longline research surveys in the 1950s carried out in the tropical Pacific Ocean with recent data (1990s) collected by observers on pelagic longline fishing vessels, which have been standardized to account for differences in depth and soak time (Ward and Myers 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong><br/>This species is caught in tuna and swordfish longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent gillnets, with other wide-ranging oceanic shark species in this region. In the tuna and swordfish longline fisheries some vessels now also target sharks due to the increasing demand and commercial value of fins, particularly in Brazil and Uruguay (Domingo 2000). The landed catch and CPUE of Bigeye Thresher in the Santos (São Paulo) tuna longline fishery increased from 1971 to 1989, and then gradually decreased from 1990 to 1996 (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Amorim <em>et al</em>. 1998). In later years a switch to shallower set longlines in the fishery (to target swordfish instead of tuna) reduced the catch of most sharks and may have affected the CPUE time-series which continued to show a decrease to 2001 (A. Amorim pers. obs.). Both <em>A. superciliosus</em> and <em>A. vulpinus</em> are caught in the Brazil Santos longline fishery, with <em>A. superciliosus</em> comprising the large majority of the catch and <em>A. vulpinus</em> only a small proportion of captures (Sadowsky and Amorim 1977). <em>A. superciliosus</em> has also been documented as bycatch in the industrial tuna longline fishery operating out of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil (Hazin <em>et al.</em> 1990). Off Uruguay, CPUE values obtained from the pelagic longline fishery observer program for 2001-2005 are very low and show no clear trend (Berrondo <em>et al.</em> 2006). It is also taken by the Taiwanese tuna longline fishery operating in the South Atlantic (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific</strong><br/>This species is taken by a variety of pelagic fisheries throughout many areas of its range in the Indo-West Pacific. Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). The amounts of sharks caught by longliners targeting swordfish in the Indian Ocean have been constantly increasing since the mid-1990s and some have switched to targeting sharks in recent years (IOTC 2006). Large gillnet fisheries operating off India and Sri Lanka have also been taking important catches of pelagic sharks since the 1980s. Finning and discarding of carcasses has also been reported, especially in offshore and high seas fisheries (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005, IOTC 2006). A recent review of fisheries in the Indian Ocean (Young <em>et al. </em>2006) reported that sharks in this region are considered fully to over-exploited.<br/><br/><em>A. superciliosus</em> is known to be taken by the Spanish surface longline fleet for swordfish and sharks, Korean tuna longline fleet and others operating in the Indian Ocean (García-Cortés and Mejuto 2000, Yang <em>et al.</em> 2005). Mejuto <em>et al.</em> (2006) report that fishing effort in this Spanish fleet has increased since 1993. It is also documented in catches of Spanish experimental cruises in the Southwest Indian Ocean (Ariz <em>et al.</em> 2006). South Africa's longline fisheries for tuna set a total of 21 million hooks between 2000 and 2005. Observer coverage (14%) indicated that the shark bycatch of this fishery comprised 4% thresher sharks, after Blue Shark, Shortfin Mako and Crocodile Shark (IOTC 2006). It is a known catch of tuna and shark longline and driftnet fisheries operating in the Indian Ocean and areas of the western Pacific (Rajruchithong <em>et al.</em> 2005, White <em>et al.</em> 2006). IOTC collects catch information for sharks, but this is considered very incomplete and cannot be used to estimate total catches of sharks in the Indian Ocean, even for species for which partial data are available (IOTC) (IOTC 2006). Both <em>A. superciliosus</em> and <em>A. pelagicus</em> have been reported in the catches but as noted above, no information is available to estimate the magnitude of catches or trends.<br/><br/>Japanese assessment of data from research longline surveys in the Pacific and Indian Oceans suggests that thresher shark (<em>Alopias</em> spp.) catch per unit effort increased in the 1990s (to near one shark per 1,000 hooks) over levels in the 1970s (near zero sharks per 1,000 hooks). However, this result is thought to be possibly attributable to an increase in hook depths in the latter period. In recent years, based on logbook data, recorded Japanese catches of thresher sharks worldwide ranged from 252 to 596 mt with an average of 347 mt. The resource is considered stable with no management action required other than ongoing monitoring (Japan Fisheries Agency 2006). Coastal longline fishermen off the coast of Japan report that they retain thresher sharks preferentially over other sharks because of their lower urea content. One fishermen cited values of 250 USD per shark for thresher shark carcasses (Gilman <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Although complete data on are not available for evaluation from this region, this species is a known catch of many fisheries operating throughout much of its range in this region, as described above. Given that this species has high biological vulnerability and a low intrinsic rate of increase, coupled with the declines observed in other areas of its range, declines are inferred based on continuing high levels of exploitation.","In Northwest Atlantic US waters, the Bigeye Thresher Shark (<em>Alopias superciliosus</em>), has been listed as a Prohibited Species under the Fishery Management Plan of the Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks (NMFS 2003) since 2000. The U.S Fishery Management Plan for Highly Migratory Species by the NMFS provides a biennial review of the status of Bigeye Thresher with management contingent on the health of the stock (PFMC 2004). No catch guidelines are recommended at this time on the West coast of the USA.<br/><br/>Family Alopiidae is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which urges States to cooperate over the management of these species. No such management yet exists. Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is urgently needed for this biologically vulnerable shark. It is also essential to improve data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Listing on international resource management agreements, such as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) could help to drive improvements in national and regional management and facilitate collaboration between states, for this species and other migratory sharks.<br/><br/>The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia), regional entities (EU) and regional fisheries organisations (e.g., ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) is accelerating and should increasingly prevent the fishing of thresher sharks for their fins alone.",Decreasing,"Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations are presumably largely isolated. An ongoing genetic study of global population structure in <em>A. superciliosus</em> using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region indicates no structuring of populations within the Pacific Ocean, but significant genetic structure between Bigeye Threshers in the northwest Atlantic and those in the Pacific Ocean (Trejo 2004).

This species is frequently caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries (Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006), is also fished with anchored bottom and surface gillnets, and is a bycatch of other gear including bottom trawls and fish traps (Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006). Although sometimes referred to as a bycatch in fisheries for other pelagic fishes, this bycatch is normally utilised and would better be described as a secondary target catch. They are also an important sport fishery resource, the meat is considered excellent for consumption, and the large fins highly valued. The growing and largely unregulated shark fin trade also represents a serious threat to thresher sharks. Clarke <em>et al.</em> (2006) report that thresher sharks compose at least 2-6% of the trade in a market study using DNA-based species identification techniques.<br/><br/>The impact of fisheries on <em>A. vulpinus</em> on a global scale, while difficult to assess, has most likely been significant. For example, Japanese and Russian vessels fish the northwest Indian Ocean and central Pacific, and Mexican-Japanese joint ventures have operated longline vessels off Baja California, Mexico, for many years. Furthermore, the number of pelagic sharks landed by fishing fleets in all oceans has become increasingly important in recent years (Mejuto <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, catch statistics are not available (Compagno 2001, Holts 1988, Smith 1998) and where they are, they are under-reported. A recent FAO review of the status of highly migratory pelagic species states: """"unless demonstrated otherwise, it is prudent to consider <em>Alopias</em> species as being fully exploited or overexploited globally"""" (Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central Pacific</strong><br/>A target pelagic gillnet fishery for this species developed off the west coast of the USA, Eastern Central Pacific (particularly California, and also Washington and Oregon) in the late 1970s (Goldman 2005, Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006). This fishery serves as a well documented case of population depletion and provides strong evidence that there are numerous isolated subpopulations or stocks globally. Starting with 15 vessels in 1977, the fishery expanded to over 225 vessels in 1982 (Holts 1988, Hanan <em>et al</em>. 1993). The fishery peaked in 1982 with reported landings of 1,089.5 t (Anonymous 1993), declining due to overfishing to less than 300 t by the late 1980s (Maguire <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fishing had heavily reduced the number of juvenile and subadult <em>A. vulpinus</em> off central and southern California, virtually eliminating them from the catch. In 1996, California catches of Common Thresher Shark were down to one-fifth of former levels (Smith 1998). This fishery was effectively eliminated by restrictions on the use of gill nets by 1990 (Bedford 1992, Smith 1998, Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006). It was originally believed that a Pacific-wide distribution of the species would act as a buffer against over-harvesting (Bedford 1992, Smith 1998). However, this was shown not to be the case, as that portion of the population remained at low levels for several years, and is only reappeared in the catch records and in market places some time later (Bedford 1992, Smith 1998). The species is still caught as bycatch or as a secondary target, although to a far lesser extent, of the swordfish gillnet fishery and may be sold for higher prices in the market than swordfish (Bedford 1992, Smith 1998, Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>While the majority of fishery data for this species in the Pacific has come from California, it is fished in numerous locations throughout its range there. The Spanish pelagic longline fishery for swordfish and sharks is expanding rapidly in the Pacific, with effort expanding from the traditional grounds in the southeast Pacific into the central south Pacific and areas of the north Pacific in recent years (Mejuto 2005). <em>A. vulpinus</em> is taken in both artisanal and commercial longline fisheries in areas off South America, including Peru and Chile (M. Romero pers. comm., Bonfil <em>et al</em>. 2005). Hong Kong customs data shows that Peru is amongst the 20 countries that export the most dried fins to Hong Kong (Bonfil <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific</strong><br/>Little information is currently available on <em>A. vulpinus</em> in the Indo-West Pacific. Whereas records of <em>A. superciliosus</em> and <em>A. pelagicus</em> are recorded in the catches of fisheries operating in this region, albeit very under-reported, very little information is available on catches of <em>A. vulpinus</em>. Although pelagic fishing effort in this region is high, with reported increases in recent years, <em>A. vulpinus</em> is more characteristic of cooler waters and further information needs to be collected on records and catches of the species in this region.<br/><br/><strong>Northwest and Western Central Atlantic</strong><br/>Thresher sharks are also an important pelagic species in the north Atlantic, although <em>A. vulpinus</em> is only sporadically recorded in the northwest and western central Atlantic and <em>A. superciliosus</em> is the more common thresher shark in this area. Thresher sharks are generally recorded by genus by observers as well as in logbooks. Analysis of U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline data from their scientific observer program for 1992-2005, suggest that the region of the US east coast where <em>A. vulpinus</em> is somewhat common is from about 35°N-40°N (approximately North Carolina to Philadelphia), where <em>A. vulpinus</em>: <em>A. superciliosus</em> are caught in a ratio of ~1:3 (Baum unpublished data). The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fishing pressure is high and ongoing and as <em>A. vulpinus</em> is an incidental catch in these fisheries monitoring of catches of this species is extremely limited. Currently, there are no management measures specific to this species in any EEZ or within international waters, and no stock assessments have been done. In Canada and the U.S., less than 5% of the pelagic longlining fleets are monitored by observers, making it difficult to elucidate reliable trends in abundance from these data. Fisheries monitoring in international waters is even more limited. The pelagic longline fishing grounds for the US fleet extend from the Grand Banks (about 45°N) in the northwest Atlantic to 5-10°S off the South American coast, within which geographical areas of longline fishing are defined for classification (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Baum <em>et al</em>. (2003) concluded from their analysis of Northwest Atlantic pelagic longline data that the relative abundance of all thresher sharks (<em>A. vulpinus</em> and <em>A. superciliosus</em> combined) had declined 80% from 1986-2000. This analysis is based on estimates of trends in abundance from standardized catch rate indices of the U.S. pelagic longline fishery logbook data, and the fifteen year time period is over one generation length for this species. Although the analysis is not species specific, the sample size of thresher sharks in this data is over 20,000. Furthermore, the area covered by the dataset analysed, ranging from the equator to about 50°N, encompasses the confirmed range of <em>A. vulpinus</em> in these two regions (Compagno 2001). An alternative analysis of the same logbook dataset for 1986-2005 that also combined <em>A. vulpinus</em> and <em>A. superciliosus</em>, resulted in an overall decline of 63% (Cortés <em>et al. </em>2007). Fishing pressure on thresher sharks began over two decades prior to the start of this time series, thus the estimated declines are not from virgin biomass.<br/><br/>A more recent analysis of <em>Alopias</em> species trends from scientific observer data between 1992 and 2005 in the same U.S. pelagic longline fishery found an almost identical instantaneous rate of decline (-0.12 up to the year 2000) as in the logbook analysis (Baum <em>et al.</em> unpublished manuscript). For this nine year period (1992-2000), the decline amounts to 68%, therefore the decline back to when the fishery started in the 1960s (less than three generation period of 51 years) would be much greater. However, because of recent increases in the catch rates in 2004 and 2005, the overall trend from 1992-2005 of -0.024 was non-significant, and would amount to only a 26% decline (Baum <em>et al</em>. unpublished manuscript). Cortés <em>et al.</em> (2007) also conducted an alternative analysis of this same observer dataset for the same time period that also combined <em>A. vulpinus</em> and <em>A. superciliosus</em>. This analysis of the observer dataset showed a trend opposite to that of the logbook analysis, with a 28% increase since 1992. In contrast, the nominal observer series showed a 39% decline and the logbook index for the same time period showed a decrease of 50%. Furthermore the sample size in the observer analysis was much smaller (n=14-84) than that in the logbook analysis (n=112-1,292) and thus the trend estimated should be regarded with caution. Cortés <em>et al.</em>'s (2007) observer analysis was restricted to four out of the 11 geographical areas covered by the pelagic longline fishing fleet to keep a balanced statistical design (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007). Their full logbook analysis, which showed an overall decline of 63%, had much larger sample sizes and is thus better to estimate trends with more certainty (Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong><br/>The thresher shark <em>A. vulpinus</em> is not as common in regional longline catches compared as the bigeye thresher <em>A. superciliosus</em>. Amorim <em>et al</em>. (1998) document its occurrence in the Santos (São Paulo) tuna longline fishery as """"low"""" with only six specimens observed from 1974 to 1996. Gadig <em>et al.</em> (2001) reported on small numbers of juveniles taken by gillnet off São Paulo State.<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>Adults and juveniles of <em>Alopias vulpinus</em> are regularly caught as bycatch in longline, purse seine and mid-water fisheries throughout the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in recreational fisheries (Lipej <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species has some important parturition and nursery areas in the Mediterranean (Adriatic and Alboran Seas). Moreno and Moron (1992) observed aggregations of pregnant females of <em>A. vulpinus</em> in the Strait of Gibraltar.<br/><br/>Even though driftnetting is banned in Mediterranean waters, this practise has continued illegally (WWF 2005). The Moroccan swordfish driftnet fleet in the Alboran Sea operates year round, resulting in high annual effort levels (Tudela <em>et al</em>. 2005). Even though sharks are a secondary target or bycatch of this fishery, some boats deploy driftnets 1-2 miles from the coast where the chance of capturing pelagic sharks is higher. The catch rate for <em>A. vulpinus</em> is higher in boats actively fishing for sharks (from 0.7 to 1.5 N/fishing operation and 0.09 to 0.11 catch per km net). Both annual catches and mean weights of <em>Alopias vulpinus</em> have fallen as a result of fishing mortality in the Moroccan driftnet fishery, illustrating the likely impact of this illegal fishery on stocks in the Alboran Sea and adjacent Atlantic (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2005). Valeiras <em>et al.</em> (2003) also report that pelagic sharks are forming an increasing proportion of the catch of Spanish swordfish sleets. Pelagic fishing pressure is high and ongoing throughout the Mediterranean Sea (Tudela 2004, Megalofonou <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/><em>A. vulpinus</em> is caught primarily as a bycatch of longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish in the northeast Atlantic, and are also taken in driftnets and gillnets (ICES 2005, 2007). As a highly valuable species, it is very likely that this bycatch is retained (ICES 2005). Limited information is available on thresher shark catch in this region. ICES 2006 reports estimated landings of thresher shark at 13-107 t from 1996 to 2005 in the ICES area, however these data are still considered incomplete. Prior to 2000, estimated landings fluctuated at 17-13 t, in 2000-2001 they exceeded 100 t, after which they dropped to 4 t in 2002 and have not exceeded 7 t since. Increased targeting of pelagic sharks by Moroccan drift-netters in the Alboran Sea and Strait of Gibraltar (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2005), mentioned above, has also likely impacted <em>A. vulpinus</em> in this area.","Time and area restrictions were imposed off California, USA, since 1990, but <em>A. vulpinus</em> is not managed internationally and there are no quotas.<br/><br/>Family Alopiidae is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which urges States to cooperate over the management of these species. No such management yet exists. Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is urgently needed for this biologically vulnerable shark. It is also essential to improve data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Listing on international resource management agreements, such as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) could help to drive improvements in national and regional management and facilitate collaboration between states, for this species and other migratory sharks.<br/><br/>The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia), regional entities (EU) and regional fisheries organisations (e.g., ICCAT, IATTC, WCPFC) is accelerating and should increasingly prevent the fishing of thresher sharks for their fins alone.",Decreasing,"Common Thresher Sharks appear to exhibit little to no immigration and emigration between geographic areas. The California drift gill net fishery provided insight into the population dynamics of this species, indicating that numerous isolated subpopulations or stocks exist globally (see Threats section). An ongoing global population genetic study (Trejo 2004) using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region indicates significant structuring of <em>A. vulpinus</em> populations within the Pacific Ocean, and significant structure between Pacific and northwest Atlantic populations. Differences in length at maturity and fecundity of specimens examined from different regions of the world also provides evidence for isolated subpopulations or stocks (Gubanov 1972, Moreno <em>et al</em>. 1989, Bedford 1992). In the absence of records of transatlantic migrations a single northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean stock of <em>A. vulpinus</em> is assumed (ICES 2007).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Restoration efforts centering around stocking programs have been used for many alosine fishes including this species. However, studies have identified a risk to genetic viability of populations when using such approaches.<br/><em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is presently managed under Amendment Three of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Shad Fishery Management Plan, only allowing for catch and release via hook and line only, for states without an approved sustainable fishing plan (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). The purpose of this sustainable fishing plan for Massachusetts is to allow continuation of fishing, while planning for population restoration within rivers where populations are low and others where information is limited (Sheppard and Chase, 2012).<br/><br/>It is advised that future restoration efforts proceed by providing access to historical spawning grounds, either through dam removal or through providing effective fish passage, followed by natural recolonization of reclaimed habitat (Hasselman and Limburg 2012). The construction of fish elevators and ladders around dams have also been implemented to help recover the spawning pathways for this species, otherwise blocked or isolated by dams (Brown and St Pierre 2001). However, an example of the low level of upstream passage efficiency is at of the Pawtucket Dam in Lowell. Between 1989 and 2009 it was found on average only 29% of fish that pass through the Essex Dam fish lift will ascend the lift at the Pawtucket Dam (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). Sprankle (2005) assessed passage efficiency at the Lowell Dam and found 66% of the <em>Alosa sapidissima</em> at the Essex Dam arrived at the pool downstream of the Lowell Dam, and 55% entered the dam tailrace, but only 4% entering the tailrace passed the Lowell Dam fish lift. No ripe shad have been caught below the Essex Dam during electrofishing monitoring, indicating that no spawning habitat occurs below the dam and all fish were seeking to move upstream (Sprankle, 2005; Sheppard and Chase 2012).",Unknown,"Little population information is available for this species, however in recent years, declines have occurred throughout its range.&#160;American shad landings between the years 1990-2010, display an annual rate of decline of -4.506, monitored by the NMFS Fisheries Statistic and Economic Division, Northeast Regional Office (Sheppard and Chase, 2012).

In some rivers, restoration efforts led to increases in population abundance, from the low levels observed in 2007 within Pawcatuck and Connecticut Rivers, Rhode Island, the Potomoc River, Virginia, and the Santee River, South Carolina (ASMFC 2007, 2009).

These longline fisheries operate at depths of 130 to 847 m. Average bycatch rates in the longline fishery were 10 to 25 fish (or 35 to 75 kg) per 1,000 hooks, and this species was estimated to constitute approximately 20% of total longline catches (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005b). However, it should be noted that the uncertainty of the estimates from this method is high (approximately ±45%). Preliminary estimates indicate that total annual skate bycatch in these fisheries is 723 to 1,891 tonnes, and the Thorny Skate (<em>A. radiata</em>) composes the great majority of catches (90 to 95% of the total skate catch). Skate catches are mainly discarded in the Barents Sea, although in 2000, about 200 tonnes of grouped Thorny and Arctic Skate were landed (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005b), so future trends should be monitored. This skate is able to find refuge at depth as it primarily occurs outside the reach of fisheries.<br/></p>","In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa) and North Sea (ICES sub-area IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 meters was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999−2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore not effectively constraining catches.<br/><br/>Skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters in 2009, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES sub-areas VI−IX).

In 2013, the TAC for all skate and ray species grouped was 21,800 t (regulations are available online at <a href=""""http://faolex.fao.org"""">http://faolex.fao.org</a>).<br/><br/>Deepwater fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic have decreased in effort gradually over the past decade (Dransfeld <em>et al</em>. 2013, STECF 2014), but should still be monitored in case of future expansion, which could pose a threat to this skate.<br/><br/>Research to collect information on the biology, ecology, use, and fishery data of this species should be a priority.",Unknown,"No data on population size are available, however survey data indicate that this is the dominant skate species in certain areas, such as Davis Strait and southern Baffin Bay (Jørgensen 2005, 2011). The Arctic Skate was caught commonly during research cruises conducted on the slope of the eastern Norwegian Sea from 1984 to 1987 and in 1995 (Skjæraasen and Bergstad 2001). In the Spanish bottom trawl survey carried out on the Spitsbergen/Svalbard archipelago in 2003, it was also one of the main species caught (Paz 2003). Average annual catch rate between 1992 and 2005 was 0.6 individuals per square kilometer in the Barents Sea, which is considered ‘rare’ (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). Between 1996 and 2001 in the Barents Sea, the largest bycatch was 60-100 kilograms (kg) per hour haul, and more than 50 individuals per 1,000 hooks (Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005a). Average bycatch in the trawl fishery was 6-10 kilograms per hour haul and the maximum catch rate was 156 kg per hour. In the longline fishery, average bycatch rates were 10-25 individuals (or 35-75 kg) per 1,000 hooks, and catch rates reached 368 kg per 1,000 hooks (equivalent to a catch per vessel per day of approximately nine tonnes). These catch rates suggest that on average, this skate accounted for approximately 20% of longline catches, although they could comprise 99% of some catches.

Indeed, in the Netherlands alone there are a total of 4,671 water pumping stations which inhibit the spawning migrations of adult silver eels downstream and the upstream migration of young glass eels. Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial (e.g. agricultural) use. In North Africa, the declines in fisheries catches of all eel life history stages (but glass eel in particular) have been attributed to over-exploitation, dam construction, pollution of estuaries and water abstraction for domestic use (Azeroual 2010). It is proposed that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success.<br/><br/>In relation to this, the accumulation of lipophilic chemical pollutants by maturing eels could have potentially toxic effects on migrating adults. These chemicals are stored by the fish and released when fat stores are broken down during migration which could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low quality gametes (Robinet and Feunteun 2002).<br/><br/>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding grounds (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi et al 2005) during periods of increase and decline.<br/><br/>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to the metamorphosis of larvae into glass eels being impeded by the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of drift of larvae from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958-2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). As such, the most recent WGEEL report claims that there is still practically nothing known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of the eels life history (ICES WGEEL 2013).<br/><br/>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach their spawning grounds due to its negative influence on the fitness traits associated with the silvering stage of maturation (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012) in addition to swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007) and the ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Overfishing of glass - fisheries are primarily in France, with the UK and Spain also contributing -, yellow and silver eels across Europe is also a threat to the species. Across its distribution all continental life history stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and longevity. Export outside of Europe is now banned with any trade occurring within Europe (for consumption, culture and stocking) and quotas are in place, however, under-reporting, poaching and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European eel fisheries. These activities endanger the species and make assessment of the impact of this fishery difficult, and it’s associated management problematic.<br/><br/>Given the relative lack of understanding of the threats we have attempted to quantify this using the IUCN ‘Threat Classification Scheme’, however, this is by no means definitive.</p>","<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination which is of particular concern in relation to trans-boundary watersheds.<br/><br/>EMPs have been developed and implemented in EU Member States since the EC Regulation 1100/2007 was created to offer protection, promote recovery and increase of silver eel biomass and enhance the sustainable management of this species. The objective of each EMP is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit, with high probability, the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and these measures can include, but are not limited to; reducing commercial and recreational fisheries; restocking; improving habitats and making rivers passable; transportation of silver eels to the sea; reducing predation, amending hydro-electric power turbine schedules to reduce mortality, and developing aquaculture. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report (2013) &#160;most management actions have been for commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping stations obstacles, then measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control. Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries. A total of 756 management actions proposed in the EMPs have been implemented fully, 259 partially and 107 declared as not implemented at all (ICES WKEPEMP 2013).<br/><br/>In addition to EMPs, in 2007, the European eel was included in the CITES Appendix II in order to ensure trade of this commercially important species was sustainable. The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time all Parties to the Convention were required to issue permits for all exports of the species. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and if the export is not detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding. Finally in relation to international policy, in 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010).<br/><br/>As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total length – generally referred to as glass eel fisheries - &#160;was required to reserve a minimum of 35% of their catch for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking rivers with glass eels from elsewhere) in 2010, rising to 60% from 31 July 2013. Whether restocking programmes actually enhance the population is still open to debate. In recent years, the ICES WGEEL has annually assessed new information on the pros and cons of stocking as a suitable tool for eel recovery, with fuller reviews undertaken in 2006 and 2010 (ICES 2010). Recent reviews (WGEEL 2012, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of stocking for the recovery of the panmictic European eel population unambiguously state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions either way can be drawn (ICES WGEEL 2013). To inform this debate, however, researchers are currently seeking to determine whether stocked individuals are able to migrate as successfully and contribute to future generations to the same degree as wild individuals. Long term stocking, marking and monitoring programmes are slowly making progress in this endeavour (Wickström and Sjöberg 2013). A team of researchers in France suggest that the stage at which eels are stocked does not affect their survival (Desprez <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tagging and tracking studies, such as those being conducted as part of the EU EELIAD project, are under way in order to gain a better understanding of the marine ecology of the European Eel. Tracking is also adopted to determine the relative success of stocked eels to make spawning migrations and thus contribute to recruitment (e.g. Prigge <em>et al</em>. 2013a) and a recent paper indicates that eels from a stocked watershed migrate in a similar way to wild populations in Sweden (Westerberg <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In summary however, until stocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012).<br/><br/>Trap and transport programmes across Europe are designed to provide eels with both upstream and downstream passage and/or access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. These programmes that involve catching wild eels and moving them over relatively small distances past barriers are generally working with lower numbers of fish than restocking programmes and are very location specific. However, when applied to migrating silver eels, low in a catchment, it can have a significant and immediate effect on escapement thus potentially having a positive impact on the spawning stock. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, recruitment. There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by providing more cost-effective passes or ladders for eels to navigate.<br/><br/>Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and highly unlikely and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. The German Eel Model indicated that current levels of silver eel escapement from the Schwentine River system showed ‘distinctly lower reference escapement values’ than those set by the German EMP (Prigge et al. 2013). Indeed a report for the European Commission by Walker <em>et al</em>. (2011) review a number of assessment models (namely the Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam); Eel Density Analysis 2.0 (EDA); German Eel Model (GEM); and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II)) using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe. The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In summary, the international assessment of the eel stock collated in the 2013 ICES WGEEL report confirms “the critical state of the stock; the promising increase in recruitment observed in the last two years is set in historical perspective; but no prediction can be generated, and no evaluation of the implemented stock protection measures achieved”. There is still a critical need for improvement in the quality and consistency of data reporting at the national and Eel Management Unit (EMU) level (ICES WGEEL 2013). Further, it is important to highlight that while conservation actions of varying effectiveness are in place for <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> across its range, more is still required, and the apparent rise in recruitment that has occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2013, should not be reason to cease efforts. It was proposed that reassessment of this species will be required in five years, or sooner should considerably more data on silver eel escapement become available in the next few years.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>A subset of the recruitment index data in the ICES WGEEL 2012 report was used for analysis i.e., data collected as part of fisheries independent scientific monitoring or fisheries dependent data with an associated metric of effort (e.g. catch per unit effort (CPUE)). Other data were kindly provided by Dr Brian Knights, and this was included as part of the assessment process. Catch effort can be variable in fishing data, and under-reporting and, in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings is a serious problem in most European countries. Thus landings data cannot be accepted as a precise measure of stock status. However, trends in the reported catch data will, to some extent, reflect true changes in fishing yields. All the data were analysed to assess trends in recruitment, population and spawner escapement; however, it was primarily used to guide discussions that resulted in the broad agreement of the Critically Endangered listing by the assessment team, which was in turn supported by the majority of reviewers.<br/><br/>There are more data available for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa, however there is considerably less freshwater habitat available to the European Eel in this part of its range. For analytical purposes the North Sea subpopulation is often referred to in separate terms to the rest of Europe by ICES. This is because the decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to anywhere else (ICES WGEEL 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985.<br/><br/>Determining changes in the international stock in anguillid eels is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, freshwater populations, and escapement. Not only is there a huge time lag between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that A. anguilla are panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of A. anguilla (ICES WGEEL 2013). It has been proposed that due to the relatively short time-span between spawning and recruitment that the latter is a good indicator of the past spawning stock that produced the juvenile cohort; this will depend, to an extent, on the significance of oceanic factors on larval transport.<br/><br/>Assessment of these datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account, where this information was available, consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether they were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p><strong><br/>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;<br/></strong>The glass eel data sets used in the analyses for this IUCN Red List assessment were from The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, France, and Spain. The elver data sets used were from Norway, Sweden, Ireland and Denmark. These data sets were a mix of fisheries CPUE and scientific surveys and as many were drawn from the WGEEL 2012 report it is unsurprising that they reflect the findings of this document, and they are discussed in this context below.<br/><br/>Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent wide decline of ~90% has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. Recently, the WGEEL recruitment index (five year average) fell to its lowest historical level: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES WGEEL 2012). In the last two years however, the recruitment index has increased to 1.5% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and to 10% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, but both remain far from ‘healthy’ (ICES WGEEL 2013). This could possibly be in response to the closure of silver eel fisheries across Europe in 2009, although this increase is within the natural variation of historical records (ICES WGEEL 2012). Whilst data from catch returns indicate this increase in recruitment, the impact of the overall decline will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES WGEEL 2012). Furthermore, the use of fisheries data makes it difficult to assess the full extent of this recent increase in recruitment due to a lack of effort metrics for some data sets and the introduction of quotas which, once reached and fishing ceases, provide no way of estimating subsequent arrivals to coastal freshwater habitat.<br/><br/><strong>Yellow Eel: </strong><br/>Data sets used to assess yellow eel populations were from Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and France and were a mix of scientific fishing surveys, electrofishing and fisheries. It was raised that some of the Swedish sites may have exhibited less pronounced declines, and in some cases even increases in population, due to stocking (Wickström 1983, Neuman <em>et al</em>. 1990, Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>While the decline in yellow eel populations was not as severe as that of recruitment, the available data indicated that it was greater than 50% over three generations (45 years). It is very likely that the less pronounced decline will be partially due to density dependent mortality (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on population effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline.<br/><br/><strong>Silver Eels: <br/></strong>The data sets on silver eel escapement were from France, Norway, Ireland and Sweden and were collected from scientific surveys and fisheries.<br/><br/>Silver eel decline was not as pronounced as yellow eel populations or recruitment but, similar to yellow eels, the indication was that the decline across the range was greater than 50% over three generations. Again, this may be due to density dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in glass eels and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.<br/><br/>The EU regulation 1100/2007 – article 2.4 states “The objective of each [EU] Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock”. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report, assigned to evaluate the current progress of the Europe-wide EMPs, out of 81 eel management units (EMUs), 17 EMU are reported as achieving their biomass targets, 42 are not and 22 did not report (WKEPEMP 2013). In southern Norway, sharp declines in abundance have been observed since 2000 after relatively long periods of stability (ICES WGEEL 2012).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011) as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2005), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN 2010) Norway (Kålås <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and in regional assessments for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed the European Eel showed the largest negative population trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>For the North African range of the population there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

In an extensive review of status of the American Eel in Canada, COSEWIC (2012) identified the threats as: 1) barriers in freshwater resulting in the accumulative loss of formerly productive habitats; 2) turbine mortality of hydroelectric dams; 3) vulnerability of life stages to fisheries; 4) bioaccumulation of contaminants; 5) exotic swimbladder nematode parasite (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) potentially introduced from stocking; 6) climate change and shifting oceanic conditions. A recent report indicated that barriers to migration and fisheries were likely the greatest threats across the species’ range, while other threats would have more regional influences (Chaput <em>et al</em>. 2014). Many of the current major stressors affecting <em>A. rostrata </em>in North America are those facing other species of anguillid eels. Large barriers severely impede upstream migration of juvenile eels if no passage is provided, extirpating large areas of habitat suitable for growth and maturation of freshwater eels. Although eels are able to ascend many smaller barriers, recent studies have documented a tenfold reduction in eel density above each potentially passable barrier (Machut <em>et al</em>. 2007). Machut <em>et al</em>. also found significantly lower American Eel condition with increasing riparian urbanization in the Hudson River in the U.S.<br/><br/>Habitat loss resulting from impoundment may contribute to reduced eel abundance in eastern Canada (Jessop 2000). In the St Lawrence watershed alone, 13% (14,000 km²) of yellow eel rearing habitat is no longer accessible (DFO 2014). However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s a number of eel ladders were constructed on barriers which attempted to reduce this loss. Throughout the United States, it is reported that as much as 84% of historic stream length is now inaccessible to eels (DFO 2014). The Susquehanna River, the largest river system on the East Coast of the U.S., once supported a large numbers of eels; however the construction of Conowingo Dam, a large hydroelectric dam located near the mouth of the river as well as additional upstream dams severely limited the access to this habitat (SRAFRC 2010). Major habitat perturbations in the St. Lawrence River took place in the 1950s (e.g., construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway and hydroelectric dams), about 30 years before recruitment started declining; this long delay argues against these perturbations being primary causes of the decline (Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). However, an unpublished, long-term CPUE series (1930–1965) provides evidence that the decline occurred simultaneously with the habitat alterations (see Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). Irrespective of the causes of declines, it has been proposed that changes in flow regulation, along with changes in temperature, have affected migration behaviour (e.g., Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Passage through turbines at hydropower dams during downstream migration represents a major source of eel mortality (Ritter <em>et al</em>. 1997). Turbine-induced mortality ranges from 5 to 97%, depending on turbine type, flow rate, and length of the fish (Hadderingh 1990, McCleave pers. comm., Bussye <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cumulative direct turbine mortality from the two large hydroelectric dams on the St. Lawrence River system (Moses-Saunders and Beauharnois) accounts for a mortality of 40% of the emigrating eels (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). This had a substantial impact on spawner escapement from this once large, highly fecund northern population. Without development of suitable eel passage at hydroelectric dams, such mortality continually affects escapement at all hydroelectric facilities across the entire range.<br/><br/>The commercial harvest of all continental life stages of eels has been, and remains, a cause of significant mortality (see the <em>Use and Trade</em> section above for details). How accurately, effort-based commercial harvest data represent true population trends however, remains a strong discussion point due to the potential carrying capacity of unfished habitat. However, for the purposes of the current assessment, these areas, while being recognised as having potential importance, were not considered unless fisheries-independent monitoring data was available. Worldwide demand for eels is greater than can be supplied by harvest of wild populations, and eel farming – widespread in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China and to a lesser extent in Europe – has become a major source of marketable eels (Jessop 2000). In Asia, wild-caught glass eels and elvers are farmed to marketable size. Since captive reproduction of American eels is not yet feasible (although see Oliveira and Hable 2010), the intensive farming industry in East Asia is dependent upon an annual supply of wild-caught glass eels and elvers (Moriarty and Dekker 1997). When Asian domestic stocks are inadequate, a strong market develops for American Eels. The Asian market for American glass eels and elvers was strong from 1972 to 1977, declined dramatically in 1978, began to strengthen in the 1990s, and is now at record-high levels (Crook and Nakamura 2013). Increased worldwide demand for glass eels and elvers has led to increased poaching of the American Eel in the United States (ASMFC 2013) though the extent of this is difficult to quantify.<br/><br/>In addition to threats from harvest, they also face other challenges. American Eels from the St. Lawrence River have historically been identified as being heavily contaminated with chemicals such as PCBs, Mirex, and various pesticides (Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994, Couillard <em>et al</em>. 1997, Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). Lethal toxicity from chemical contamination has been known to occur in St. Lawrence eels for more than 30 years (Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). The highest concentrations of chemicals in migrating silver eels in the St. Lawrence River are in the gonads; chemical levels in eggs could exceed the thresholds of toxicity for larvae (Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994). Due to PCB body burdens in eels, commercial harvest of eels for human consumption has been banned throughout the Hudson River south of Glen’s Falls, NY; however, PCBs are currently being removed from the Hudson River. More recent studies indicate that levels of toxins are lower (Byer, Alaee <em>et al</em>. 2013), and while in some cases the negative effects are considered to be minimal (e.g. dioxins; Byer, Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2013), there is still regional concern in relation to other xenobiotics.<br/><br/>Oceanic effects on long-term patterns of American Eel recruitment are poorly understood, but they may play a role in the changing abundance of eels along the Atlantic coast of North America (Castonguay, Hodson, Moriarty <em>et al</em>. 1994). At the larval stage, changes in marine primary production and thus food availability associated with climate change have been suggested as a cause of population decline in the American as well as the European and Japanese Eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008). Changes in frontal locations or oceanic currents may also play a role in determining recruitment to the coast (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has recently been discovered that predation of adult eels may be a further impact in the oceanic environment (Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2012, Wahlberg <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Given the relative lack of understanding of the threats we have attempted to quantify this using the IUCN ‘Threat Classification Scheme’ coding, however, this is by no means definitive.","In the late 1990s and early 2000s there were several conservation initiatives in existence relating to fisheries and barriers to migration. However, the primary initiative for conservation concern and action for the American eel was initiated with the 2003 Quebec Declaration of Concern (Dekker <em>et al</em>. 2003) to restore the world’s anguillid eels, produced at the AFS 2003 International Eel Symposium (Casselman and Cairns 2009). But by comparison with the European Eel, integrated management has not been initiated. In December 2010, European Union member states suspended all exports and imports of European Eel commodities, placing further pressure on the American Eel to be used as seedstock for farms.<br/><br/>In Canada, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans manages American Eels in the Maritime provinces, with the powers of management transferred to the province for both Ontario and Quebec. As a result of significant declines in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, the Ontario government established a harvest quota. However, because of the precipitous decline in abundance, commercial quotas were never met, although they were reduced annually. In 2004, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources officially closed all commercial fisheries of eels as a result of the dramatic decline of eels in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River (Casselman 2003). In 2007 eels in Ontario were officially classified as “Endangered” under the Ontario Endangered Species Act and a Recovery Strategy was prepared to provide advice to government (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Recovery Strategy in Ontario is currently being assessed by the Ontario government and a formal ‘Response Statement’ is being prepared. In Ontario, there is emphasis on restoring, protecting, and diversifying suitable habitat with proposed 10% increases in availability of this habitat every year for five years (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013). A reduction in cumulative mortality (50% at the watershed level by 2050) is also designed to enhance escapement across the species range in Canada in another target set out in the DFO American Eel management plan (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). COSEWIC, in 2006, reviewed the status of the American Eel in Canada and recommended “Special Concern” but with the caveat that the species should be reassessed in five years. In May 2012, COSEWIC upgraded the Canadian status to “Threatened”.<br/><br/>In 2008, Aboriginals assembling in Ottawa, Canada, concerned about the decline of eels, prepared an Aboriginal People’s American Eel Resolution, suggesting that eels in Canada be considered “Threatened” and a willingness to give up long-standing rights with eels to see them restored. The resolution expresses concern about the harvest of glass eels and encourages co-operative action and the application of precautionary principles. This early resolution was signed by three large Aboriginal First Nations: the Algonquins of Ontario; the St. Lawrence Iroquois, represented by the Mohawks of Akwesasne; and the Mi'kmaq of the Maritimes. The Algonquins of Ontario have provided documents on the importance of the species and the need to see it returned to its historic range and their ancestral lands to guarantee their association in perpetuity (Algonquins of Ontario 2012).<br/><br/>In the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reviewed the status of the American Eel in 2007 in response to a petition it received in 2004 to list it under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). A 90-day review determined that protection under the ESA may be warranted. After examining all available information about the eel population from Greenland south along the North American coast to Brazil in South America and as far inland as the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage, the Service found declines of eel populations in some areas. After a more extensive review the Service proposed that declines of eel populations in some areas had not put the overall population in danger of extinction. In 2010 the Service received another petition seeking to extend federal protection to the American Eel. The Service found that this petition, from the Council for Endangered Species Act Reliability, presented substantial new information that warranted the initiation of another more extensive status review of the species (FR 2011). This review will be competed in 2015 and will determine whether listing the species under the ESA as Threatened is warranted.<br/><br/>American Eels along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are managed by the ASMFC . Increasing demand in the 1990s produced what were considered to be unsustainable harvest levels of eels. In 1999, the ASMFC American Eel Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) was put in place to ensure ecological stability and promote sustainable fisheries. This included yearly monitoring of glass eel recruitment followed in 2006 by a mandatory catch and effort monitoring program. Since the late 1990s, American Eel fisheries are managed by the ASMFC in territorial seas and inland waters along the U.S. Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. Increasing demand for eel by Asian markets and domestic bait fisheries, coupled with concern about declining eel abundance and limited assessment data, spurred development of the first Interstate Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for American Eel in the mid-1990s. In 2006 the ASMFC initiated the first stock assessment for American Eels. After extensive peer review the stock assessment was published in 2012. The 2012 benchmark stock assessment found that the American Eel population is depleted in U.S. waters. The stock is at or near historically low levels due to a combination of historical overfishing, habitat loss, food web alterations, predation, turbine mortality, environmental changes, toxins and contaminants, and disease (ASMFC 2012). Through multiple addendums to the American Eel Fishery Management Plan some&#160; small reductions in mortality across some life stages has been achieved, however, the need for, and extent of, additional quotas and/or reductions on the&#160; glass and yellow eels life stages have not been resolved (ASMFC 2013).<br/><br/>Dam removal and installation of eel ladders along the U.S. portion of the range is now a common restoration strategy, however, strategies to protect downstream migration though hydroelectric facilities are rare. Eel passage is currently being addressed on Conowingo Dam and some eel passage has been provided. Fish passage on other large hydro dams is addressed during the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s licensing or relicensing process. Most states are working to improve upstream eel passage on unregulated dams. A recent study shows that dam removal can increase American Eel abundances in the upstream areas (Hitt et al. 2012).<br/><br/>Increasing spawner escapement is critically important in recovery strategies, particularly involving fishing and turbine mortality, which need to be reduced and mitigated (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013), however, governance remains a major problem for the American Eel and integrated management for this panmictic species is lacking. Another possible mitigation measure involves supplementary stocking. Such stocking programs were undertaken from 2005 to 2010 in the St. Lawrence River system, on the Richelieu River, and in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The contribution of these stocked eels to the production of silver eels and subsequently to recruitment in the next generation is unknown; however, there were unexpected effects. For example, a study by Pratt and Threader (2011), of the stocking programme in the upper St.Lawrence River system showed strong evidence that stocked eels survived and grew quickly - female stocked eels started to emigrate within four years after stocking at a small size (compared to wild females), similar to the size reported for migrating wild females in their site of original capture in Nova Scotia. This said, a considerable number of the stocked eels became male in an environment where only females had previously been observed (Pratt and Mathers 2011, Pratt and Threader 2011) and the effects of this shift in sex bias and reduced size are unknown. The authors themselves highlight the limitations of this study in the context of the species' range and more long-term data are required to fully determine the effectiveness of stocking programmes. Restocking programmes, while having been shown to increase escapement in some instances, must be carefully planned and executed in river systems that will benefit from an increase in freshwater population. It is obvious that conservation concerns about the status of the American Eel are now considerable and that international cooperation and coordinated management are needed to protect a species that now has substantially reduced habitat and increasing anthropogenic stressors, with greatly reduced abundance and distribution.",Decreasing,"Data were primarily collated from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Eel Benchmark Stock Assessment (ASMFC 2012) – the body that manages American Eel stocks along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. - and from the DFO (Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans) Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) report (DFO 2014). There were very few data that related to the Southern extent of the species’ range – Central America / Caribbean – and this was taken into account during discussions. Data that were eel-specific (i.e., not part of a multi-species fishery) and/or collected as part of fisheries independent scientific monitoring or fisheries dependent data with an associated metric of effort (e.g., catch per unit effort) were given greater weight than data sets that did not meet these criteria. Catch effort can be variable in fishing data and under-reporting, and in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings is a serious problem; thus while landings data are discussed, in the absence of other data, it cannot be accepted as a precise measure of stock status. Data were analysed to assess trends in recruitment, population and spawner escapement, however, they were primarily used to guide further discussions that included threats and associated management measures. These and the associated review inputs resulted in the consensus of the ‘Endangered’ listing by assessors, contributors and reviewers.<br/><br/>According to a regional assessment and status report by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), eel abundance has seen significant declines in the last 50 years, and COSEWIC assessed the Canadian population that receives recruitment at the northernmost part of the species' range as ‘Threatened’ (COSEWIC 2012). During the ASMFC Baseline Stock Assessment for American Eel, nearly 100 fishery-dependent and independent U.S. data sources representing several life stages and geographical and temporal scales were evaluated. Ultimately, fifty-two fishery-dependent and independent data sources were selected for use in this assessment because they were considered adequate for describing life history characteristics and abundance trends of eels on either a coast-wide or regional basis. The assessment concluded that in the US the American Eel stock is depleted with the stock being at or near historically low levels (ASMFC 2012). To provide a note of historical context, Haro <em>et al</em>. (2000) analysed commercial and non-commercial data to determine population trends of <em>A. rostrata</em> along the east coast American/Canadian range from Ontario and Nova Scotia down to Virginia. Of the 16 localities analysed between the years 1984 and 1995, seven areas showed significant declines in population numbers using Mann-Kendall trend analysis, while the remaining nine were non- significant.<br/><br/>Further to this, time series data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the FAO provide details of fisheries declines in the American Eel from the southern part of its range. In Florida, a state that has sustained an eel fishery on record since 1950, numbers were highest between 1975 and 1980, with average annual catches peaking at 213 t. The last reported figures for this fishery were from 2007 with an average of 2.11 t in the five preceding years (NMFS NOAA 2012, FAO 2012). Further south, Cuba reported 0.5–1.0 t annually during the 1980s and early 1990s, but no eel catches have been reported to FAO since 1995. Conversely, in the Dominican Republic, fishing for eels is relatively recent with first records appearing in 1995 (five year average = 4 t). From 2006 to 2011 this figure has increased to 22 t. Figures from the western Atlantic Coast in Mexico began in 1984 and are characterised by long inter-annual periods of no eels caught. The most consistent periods were 1995 to 2000 with an average catch of 18 t per year before falling back to zero (NMFS NOAA 2012, FAO 2012). In 2011, an anomaly in this term saw a remarkable 140 t caught suggesting a sudden surge in effort. These fluctuating values from the southern part of the American Eel range perhaps reflect changes and surges in demand from abroad, which can quickly drive up the price of eels (see the <em>Use and Trade</em> section below). According to a 50-year average, the southern states of the U.S. contribute just 10 t per year to a commercial fishery with a combined total catch between Canada and the US averaging 1,564 t per year (Casselman 2003). Thus, fisheries-dependent data suggest that eels in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. and eastern Canada contribute disproportionally to the overall panmictic population (Barbin and McCleave 1997).<br/><br/><em><strong>Glass eels/young yellow eels</strong></em>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: East River Chester (NS, Canada), Little Egg Inlet (NJ, United States), Beaufort Inlet (NC, United States). Moses Saunders, upper St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario recruitment (ON and NY, Canada/United States), Richelieu River/Chambly Dam (QC, Canada), Highlands River and Northeast Brook (NL, Canada), Trepassey (NL, Canada), Rivière du Sud-Ouest (QC, Canada), Long Island (NY, United States), Hudson Estuary (NY, United States), Delaware River (NJ, United States), Delaware River (DE, United States), Chesapeake Bay (MD, United States), Lower Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries (VA, United States), North Carolina trawl survey (NC, United States).<br/><br/>Recruitment of young eels to areas of historically high abundance, such as the St. Lawrence River watershed, has been in decline for some time (Casselman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Casselman 2003). More recently some of these declines have slowed and appear to have stabilised and some watersheds have recently exhibited increasing trends in glass eels and elvers, but these have yet to manifest themselves as increases in continental populations (DFO 2014). This means that the population at this locality is potentially more vulnerable to future threats because of very low abundance. A few long-term data sets from eel ladders are available, and these have shown a major decline in recruitment. A severe decline has occurred in the number of eels ascending the eel ladder at the Moses-Saunders Dam (Ontario-New York) during the peak spring migration in the St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario segment of the range (Castonguay, Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994, Casselman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Casselman 2003, COSEWIC, 2006). The number of juvenile eels climbing the eel ladder declined from more than one million per year in the early 1980s to fewer than 4,000 per year in the late 1990s and to a level approaching zero by 2001. Larger numbers of eels have begun climbing the ladders again starting in 2004 indicating a reversing trend (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the US, there has been monitoring in the Hudson Estuary since the mid-1970s – this is fisheries independent but not species specific. Catches of glass eels/elvers indicate that there has been a significant decline in recruitment over this period. Further south, the situation in the Chesapeake and Delaware bays are less clear cut, over three generations, with some indices showing declines, others stable and some exhibiting increased recruitment. However, the general trend is that of a recruitment decline in this part of the US.<br/><br/>The American Eel exists in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean islands, and some Atlantic coastal areas of North and South America, however data for these regions is scant. Commercial fisheries have existed in Mexico and the Caribbean islands, specifically the Dominican Republic. FAO and FishStatJ indicate that harvest in Mexico and the Caribbean islands increased dramatically in the mid-1990s correlating with the decline in the Canadian harvest. In 2011 harvest in both jurisdictions reached a record-high, approaching almost 20% of total harvest of the American Eel (Casselman unpub. data). Evidence is that this harvest was exported to Asia for culture. This increase could be attributed to increasing abundance, but price and demand for American glass eels and elvers has increased substantially in recent years, likely due to the export of the European Eel outside of the EU being banned in 2010. As such it is more than likely that this demand for young American Eels for export is driving this increased harvest.<br/><br/>Overall, despite regional variations, and in some cases, signs of stabilisation and/or recovery in the recent past, the general picture across the data sets used, was that over the period of three generations analysed there had been a significant decline in recruitment across the species' range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Older yellow eels</em></strong>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: Bay of Quinte (ON, Canada) St Lawrence River (ON, Canada), Miramichi River, (NB Canada), Gulf of St Lawrence (Canada), Upper Mississippi River (United States).<br/><br/>All five of the data sets indicated that there had been declining trend in continental yellow eel populations over the period of three generations. Fisheries-dependent data indicate that eel harvest declines first occurred along the Atlantic Seaboard of the U.S. in the mid to late-1980s, followed by a decline in the mid-1990s in Canadian harvest. One hypothesis for this is that eels harvested in Canada are older than those harvested in the United States - mean age of silver eels is 14.1 compared to 7.6 years respectively. Hence these decreases are virtually synchronous when age is taken into consideration, reflecting an overall declining abundance of the species (Casselman 2003).<br/><br/><em><strong>Silver eels</strong></em>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: Lower St. Lawrence River x2 (QC, Canada), Rivière du Sud-Ouest (QC, Canada).<br/><br/>The three data sets showed varying changes in silver eel abundance over the period of three generations, though all were in decline. The 2012 COSEWIC assessment initiated an official review of the recovery potential of the species in Canada (DFO 2014). The number of mature individuals within the Great Lakes has been estimated from previous spawning escapement data by Verreault and Dumont (2003), who predicted silver eel departures from the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario from a model based on eel passage, commercial landings, percentage of migrating eels in the commercial catch and turbine survival rate. Recent estimates (fisheries independent data including electrofishing CPUE and tailwater surveys at dams) indicate that total spawning escapement has decreased by 65% over the period of 14 years despite a reduction in mortality from commercial fisheries (50% of fishing effort between 2002 and 2009) (G. Verreault, MRNF pers. comm. 2011; COSEWIC 2012). A number of datasets exist for the St. Lawrence River system and as declines were more extreme and occurred earlier upstream, there is value in their use in demonstrating the depth and breadth of the decline and its progression.<em></em>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Numerous anecdotal reports indicate that Sheepshead may be the perfect substitution species. Sheepshead is not a frequently targeted species by anglers and is an opportunistic fishery by commercial fishermen. While a few states conduct stock assessments for Sheepshead, the extent of the fishery may, in fact, be underestimated (Sheepshead Technical Task Force 2006).","Current management regulations in&#160;place for commercial or recreational fisheries operating on Sheepshead along the Atlantic and Gulf Coast of the United States include minimum size limits and bag limits. State-specific management measures are indicated below: <strong><u><br/></u></strong><strong><u><br/></u></strong><u>Florida</u><br/><br/>The Sheepshead fishery has been directly managed since 1996 with implementation of minimum size limit and possession limits (Murphy and MacDonald 2000). Fishery management actions enacted in the mid-1990s included: restrictions in the use of entangling nets, restricted species designation for Sheepshead, the 12-inch FL minimum- size limit, a 10-fish bag limit (changed to 15 fish), and a 50-fish commercial possession limit. Additionally, commercial fishing is restricted to the use of hook-and-line, cast net, beach or haul-seine gear, spear, with a 50-pound bycatch allowance for harvest by non-conforming gear (Munyandorero<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2006). These measures have lead to a drop in total landings and a change in size of landed fish (Munyandorero <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><u><br/>South Carolina</u><br/><br/><em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> has been managed as a federally regulated species in South Carolina where they spawn at offshore reef sites in both federal (&gt;5.556 km [three nautical miles] offshore) and state (&lt;5.556 km offshore) waters. There are currently no size restrictions for Sheepshead, and the established bag limit is 20 fish/person/day aggregated with species belonging to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) snapper-grouper management unit (McDonough <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2012, Sheepshead was removed from the SAFMC snapper-grouper management unit, and is now managed by the states, since much of the landings are from state waters (G. Sedberry pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><u>Georgia</u><u><br/></u>Georgia has minimum Total Length (TLs) 30.5 cm (12 in.) as with most of the Gulf coast states (McDonough <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;<br/><br/><u>Virginia</u><u><br/></u>Commercial fishery bag limit is 500 lbs. per vessel per day, and the recreational fishery bag limit is four fish per person per day. There are no minimum size limits set forth in Virginia (Ballenger 2011).",Stable,"<em>Archosargus probatocephalus, </em>commonly known as<em>&#160;</em>Sheepshead,&#160;is common in nearshore waters of the southeastern United States (Dutka-Gianelli and Murie 2001). Sheepshead is considered common to abundant throughout the southeastern Atlantic states as well as on the Gulf coast (Jennings 1985). <em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em>&#160;has been a major component of both commercial and recreational fisheries along the southeastern coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico.&#160;This species is one of the top 50 stocks landed by marine recreational fishers in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (rank numbers 43 and 14, respectively); average recreational landings in metric tons (mt) from 2000-2004 in the South Atlantic is 757 mt and 2,122 mt in the Gulf of Mexico (Figueira and Coleman 2010). <em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> is very common off Mexico (M. Vega-Cendejas pers. comm. 2013).&#160;<p><u>Commercial Landings</u></p><p>Commercial catch statistics for the Atlantic and Gulf States show an increasing trend in landings from 1950-2012, with a peak at 2,280 metric tons in 1993, after which commercial landings decline so that in 2012 commercial harvest of Sheepshead along the southeastern coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico was approximately equal to that observed in the early 1980s (<em>c. </em>560 metric tons). FAO total capture production for the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic from 1999-2011 also show a decreasing trend with an estimated decline of <em>c. </em>43% over the past three generations of this species (13 years). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) commercial catch statistics for the Atlantic and Gulf States also show an overall decreasing trend over a period of 13 years (1999-2012) with an overall decline in annual catch of 66% (landings in metric tons). This decrease in commercial landings is attributed to enactment of laws limiting or banning the use of entanglement nets in Florida (1994; Florida Constitution as amended by Article X, Section 16), Louisiana (Louisiana Marine Resources Conservation Act of 1995), and Georgia (2000; Georgia General Assembly Code Section 27-4-7).&#160;</p><p><u>Recreational Fisheries&#160;</u></p><p>NMFS Recreational Catch Statistics show an overall decreasing trend in the number of Sheepshead harvested from 1981-2013 with a &#160;peak of 4,281,833 in 1992. In the period from 2000-2013 (three generation lengths), the overall trend in numbers of fishes in all Atlantic and Gulf states is decreasing (NOAA NMFS Marine Recreational Information Program, http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/). Sheepshead is the eighth most harvested estuarine species by weight in the U.S. recreational fishing sector (2000-2004) with harvest weight of 31,568,921 lbs and accounting for 3% of the national recreational harvest. This species is primarily harvested in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions. The Gulf of Mexico represents the largest proportion of the United States' recreational estuarine harvest that is brought to shore; in this region the Sheepshead is one of the top three estuarine species harvested from 2000-2004, and together with the Red Drum and Spotted Seatrout, contributed to 39% of the region's recreational harvest (Lellis-Dibble&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.&#160;</span>2008).&#160;</p><u>Landings by region</u><br/><p><u>Florida</u></p>Sheepshead are significantly more important as a recreational species than a commercial species, with approximately 81 and 94% of the annual statewide catch taken by recreational anglers (Munyandorero <em>et al.</em> 2006). The commercial and recreational fisheries for Sheepshead are characterized by the use of a mixture of gear, particularly for the commercial fishery, with landings made from throughout Florida's estuarine and nearshore waters. Most landings came from the recreational sector (since 1982), and in recent years this fishery has accounted for nearly 90% of the total landings in weight compared to about 80% of the total prior to 1996.&#160;The annual combined recreational and commercial landings of Sheepshead in Florida were about 2.73 million pounds in 2004. On the Atlantic coast, the total harvest averaged about 1.6 million pounds during the period 1982-1995 but dropped to less than one million pounds each year since 1996. The combined recreational and commercial landings on the Gulf coast show the same trend with an annual average of 2.4 million pounds landed over the period 1982-1995 but only about 1.9 million pounds each year since 1996. The estimated recreational effort (CPUE) was lower on the Atlantic coast than on the Gulf coast. The numbers of estimated trips between 1982-2004 were characterized by multiple peak years and generally varied without trends on both coasts (Munyandorero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual commercial landings of<em> A. probatocephalus</em> in Florida peaked at around one million pounds between 1992-1994 and varied without trend at lower levels (286,000-393,000 pounds) from 1996-2004. The sharp decline in statewide commercial landings of Sheepshead observed since 1995 coincided with the implementation of the entangling net restrictions enacted in July 2005 and a 12-inch minimum-size limit and possession limit enacted in January 1996&#160;(Munyandorero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Commercial Sheepshead landings decreased 68%, while effort fell 63%, and ex-vessel price also increased from $0.49 to $0.84, which contributed to a lesser dockside value decrease of 45% since the enforcement of the net ban (Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, accessed 24 February 2014). The standardized commercial catch per unit effort (reported as landings per trip) did not show a significant change from 1986-2004 on the Atlantic coast but has increased on the Gulf Coast (Munyandorero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).<br/><br/>Results from the 2006 stock assessment of Sheepshead off of Florida waters indicate that recent levels of indices of abundance equal or exceed estimated abundances for past years. Additionally, the increasing trend in Transitional spawning potential ratios (<em>t</em>SPR) since 1996 indicate that Sheepshead population have increased in Florida (Munyandorero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).<br/><br/><u>Gulf of Mexico</u><br/><br/><em>Archosargus probatocephalus </em>is caught commercially, recreationally, and incidentally throughout the Gulf of Mexico region (Sheepshead Technical Task Force 2006). An assessment of the early life stage survival of coastal fishes following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill indicate that there was an increasing trend in CPUE of Sheepshead following large scale fisheries closures after the oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Fodrie and Heck 2011). This species is very abundant in waters around oil platforms and artificial structures in the Gulf. There have been recorded declines in catch landings in the northern Gulf of Mexico of 63% over <em>c. </em>13 years (generation length of 4.5 years), with Louisiana driving the majority of the commercial landings. Elsewhere in its range (Mexico), stable catches have been reported from 2002-2011 for a number of species together with Sheepshead.&#160;The 2004 stock assessment for Florida waters indicated that current exploitation levels of Sheepshead are sustainable (Munyandorero <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, given the decline of 63% occurring in &#160;47% of its range in the Gulf (based on population decline estimates in the United States), this represents <em>c. </em>30% reduction in landings throughout its range in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, commercial catch landings (through 2012) show declines in catches by 21% (2007-2012). These declines in landings have been attributed to enactment of laws, and are also driven by multiple factors including socio-economic considerations (e.g., fuel prices, diet preferences, etc.) and natural disasters (hurricanes).&#160;<br/><br/>In Louisiana where 63% of the commercial landings of Sheepshead in the Gulf are reported, estimates of yield and spawning potential models (range of M = 0.2 and 0.3), indicated that at M = 0.2, the fishery from 1999-2008 was operating below F<sub>0.1</sub>&#160;and well below F<sub>max</sub>, with yield of 69% to 77% of maximum, and Spawning Per Recruit (SPR) at 51% to 59% (conservation target of 30% SPR). At M = 0.3, this resulted in a more lightly fished stock with yield at 35% to 44% of maximum and SPR at 72% to 78%. Commercial landings have generally declined from a high of 3.7 million pounds in 1993 to <em>c. </em>1.6 million pounds in 2002 and 2003, 1.5 million pounds in 2004, and one million pounds in 2005. The decline observed in 2005 (continuing into 2006 landings) could be attributed partly to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which damaged fishing vessels, gear, infrastructure, and logistics throughout the region. During 2005-2006, many Louisiana-based inshore, nearshore, and offshore marine commercial finfish fisheries were significantly impacted by these natural causes and showed substantial declines in effort and landings (Blanchet 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Recreational harvest estimates in Louisiana showed a general increasing trend in 1999 through 2005, with a peak in 2004 at 3.3 million pounds of Sheepshead landed. Recreational harvests from 1981-2008 were equal to those of the commercial fishery until 1987 when the commercial fishery began to expand. In the years 2002-2005, recreational harvest was again equal to or greater than the commercial harvest. However, total harvest was higher than was seen in the early 1980s. In 2006, recreational harvest was below the levels seen in other recent years. This is likely in part due to the fact that <em>Archosargus probatocephalus</em> is not considered a primary target species for recreational fishers. The CPUE for the recreation fishery fluctuated with no indication of a long-term trend from 1981-2007 (Blanchet 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Recreational Sheepshead landings in all Gulf states show an increasing trend (1981-2012) with Florida making up 46% of the reported landings. Although Florida recreational landings show a decreasing trend (50% reduction from 1993-2012, over three generations), assessments of Sheepshead indicate that this species was fished near the maximum yield-per-recruit in 1994, but fishing mortality has since declined in response to several management initiatives in Florida. &#160;The associated decline in fishing mortality and shift in age-specific vulnerability to the fishery has been enough to allow for the increase in the spawning stock of Sheepshead in Florida (Munyandonero <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;<br/><br/><u>South Carolina</u><br/><br/>Although Sheepshead is reported as a commercial species, it is not targeted by commercial fisheries and historically has been considered as by-catch in commercial shrimp trawling or offshore longlining operations (NMFS 2006). Commercial landings from 1981-2005 made up only 0.28% of the total commercial landings for the southeastern U.S. Atlantic coast. Annual catches have been variable since the 1960s with no long-term trend in the landings (NMFS 2006, McDonough<em> et al.</em> 2011). Creel survey data from 1995-2004 indicate that the ten-year averages of the monthly percentage of annual Sheepshead landings from surveying private boat anglers at coastal boat landings is relatively constant year-round (South Carolina State Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey, http://www.dnr.sc.gov/cwcs/pdf/Sheepshead.pdf accessed 10 February 2011). Fish are present in the fishery every month of the year with peaks in landings in the spring and fall months. NMFS Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) data for the South Carolina Sheepshead fishery show that the fishery is made up primarily of private boat anglers targeting the fish in inland and nearshore waters (NMFS 2005).<br/><br/><u>Chesapeake Bay<br/></u><u><br/></u>Recreational harvest for the Sheepshead is increasing in recent years with the annual recreational harvest increasing from 1,583 fish in 1999 to 20,319 in 2005. This order of magnitude increase in recreational landings in the Chesapeake Bay over a period of six years (1999-2005) prompted closer attention and careful development of &#160;the fishery by the Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) of Virginia and recreational anglers (Ballenger 2011).<strong><u><br/></u></strong><strong><br/></strong><u>Southern Atlantic</u><br/><br/>In Brazil, it is common in the southern part where it is a component of bycatch from trawls (L.

During 2002, 120 tonnes of&#160;<em>A. spinifer</em>&#160;were landed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). FAO landings for this species show increases in total catches for the Persian Gulf from 1980 through 2007 (FAO 2009).&#160;Since 1994, landings of sparids (including&#160;<em>A. spinifer</em>) have shown a general trend for increasing annual catches and in 2006, 6,185 tonnes of sparids (including&#160;<em>A. spinifer</em>) were landed accounting for 16.5% of demersal fish landings in Omani waters (Al-Mamry&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;The&#160;<em>Argyrops spinifer</em>&#160;stock appears to be in a healthy condition in the Arabian Sea, as a wide range of size and age classes were caught in the hand-line (Al-Mamry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009) and industrial trawl fisheries (McIlwain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). By comparison,&#160;<em>A. spinifer</em>&#160;caught in the trap-fishery in the southern Persian Gulf tend to be smaller (14–40 cm LT) and younger (under five years old) (Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). However, this is probably a reflection of the fishing gear used, since fishing traps used in Omani coastal waters similarly catch smaller-sized&#160;<em>A. spinifer</em>&#160;(25–45 cm LT) (Al-Mamry 2006).&#160;Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2006) conducted a trawl survey in the Persian Gulf from 2003–2004 to assess the abundance of demersal fish resources in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.&#160;<em>Argyrops spinifer</em><em>&#160;</em>contributed 1.36% of the total biomass from the Persian Gulf and 2.30% from the Oman Sea.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the Western Indian Ocean,&#160;<em>Argyrops spinifer</em>&#160;is found off Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal extending north to Kenya, but&#160;is not plentiful in these countries (Mann and Fennessy 2000). However, it is one of the most common marine fish species seen in fish markets in southeast Madagascar and some of the catch from here and from the Tamatave region is exported from Madagascar (S.

The species is present in several large MPAs on the South African coast including de Hoop Nature Reserve, Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park, and the Sardinia Bay Reserve (World Database of Protected Areas, accessed 11 March 2014). Large MPAs with a substantial amount of reef habitat have been shown to have a positive impact on the protection of this species (Brouwer <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Brouwer and Griffiths 2004, 2005, 2006).&#160;The population declines&#160;experienced by <em>A. argyrozona</em>&#160;in the 20th&#160;century&#160;would have been greater had the stocks not been&#160;supplemented by partially protected adult stocks on the offshore Agulhas Bank and in Transkei waters (Griffiths 2000).<br/><br/>The minimum landing size for this species was increased from 25 to 35 cm TL in 2005 (Winker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), but a catch limit for the trawl fishery is presently being negotiated.

Inshore trawl CPUE for <em>A. argyrozona&#160;</em>for the period 1985 to 1994 was 2.8% and 2.4% of the historical peaks from the period 1944 to 1954 for the Southeastern Cape and the Southern Cape, respectively. Fishery independent data from surveys conducted from 1931 to 1933 and 1987 to 1993 indicate that CPUE for&#160;<em>A. argyrozona</em>&#160;declined by 75% between the two periods (Griffiths 2000).

However, CPUE has improved substantially as a result of the commercial effort reduction with the long-term rights allocation in 2006 and the removal of larger deck boats from the fishery (Winker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, 2013).

Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the entire linefishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term fisheries rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 2012). <br/></p><p>In the Southwestern Cape, catches of this species declined consistently in the early 20th<sup> </sup>century but peaked in the Southern Cape during the period 1927 to 1931 as a result of the introduction of motorized vessels which facilitated offshore exploitation (Griffiths 2000).&#160;<em>Argyrozona argyrozona&#160;</em>contributes on average 3% to the total linefish catch with no discernible trend in the last ten years (National Marine Linefish System&#160;unpublished data) but is the most important sparid by catch volume in the commercial linefishery in South Africa (Kerwath and Winker 2013).

In the coastal waters of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina and Uruguay (34°-41°S), biomass estimates fell more than 50% from 1994 to 1999 (Hozbor and Massa unpublished data). In an observer program of the Puerto Quequen coastal benthic trawl fishery in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, A. cyclophora was found to constitute 3.7% by number and 4.0% by mass of the batoids captured, and occurred in 34.2% of trawls (Tamini <em>et al</em>. 2006).

To determine whether or not the stock could be rebuilt (B/BMSY =1.0) within a ten year time frame, projections were carried out to the years 1999-2008. These projections indicate that the stock may be overfished, that overfishing is still occurring, and that catches should at least be held constant or preferably reduced to bring the stock back to healthy levels. The production model analyses utilized to project the stock trajectory indicated that current fishing mortality rates were not sustainable (Valle <em>et al</em>. 2001). Although management efforts are in place for the Gulf of Mexico population (see the Conservation Actions section for detailed management measures), no indications of population recovery were evident as of 2014. The next benchmark assessment for <em>B. capriscus</em> is scheduled for 2015.<br/><br/>An aggregated production model indicated that there were uncertainties in the ASPIC models used, due to sensitivity of the model. Robust conclusions from the model results cannot be determined, as the data were not adequate to resolve the status of the stock; however, nearly every run conducted resulted in the stock being overfished and experiencing overfishing. It is noted that this model should be explored further (Nowlis and Saul 2005).<br/><br/>A benchmark assessment was performed in 2006, and updated in 2011 using the same statistical catch-at-age-model (SSASPM). Results suggest the stock is overfished and experiencing overfishing. The stock was approaching an overfishing condition in 2005, but was not yet overfished. A rebuilding plan was established 2008 to rebuild the stock within 10 years, but there is currently no evidence of substantial improvements in stock status. The ratio of SSBcurrent/SSBMSY ranged from 0.24-0.39. Using the Gulf-wide shrimp effort model, which was evaluated as containing the least amount of uncertainty, SSB in 2010 was estimated at 6.90E+11, which is roughly 60% below the SSBMSY proxy of 1.78E+12. Fcurrent in 2010 was estimated at 0.35, which is above FMSY of 0.34. Estimates of fishing mortality ranged from 0.53 to 0.35 depending on the model used in the 2011 update (in 2006 fishing mortality was estimated at 0.435). The overall trend in SSB from 1963 (when the stock was assumed to be unfished) to 2010 is one of decline – current SSB is roughly 15-20% of original, un-fished biomass. The preferred model from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico stock assessment estimated that spawning stock biomass declined by 43-58% during the past three generation lengths (12-14 years) (see table A-24 in SEDAR 2011). The continuity model estimated that spawning stock biomass declines were slightly higher, 62-69% over three generation lengths (see Table A-1 in SEDAR 2011). In addition, models suggested recruitment has also decreased; depending on model specifications, the declines range from 51-68% to&#160; 84-87% in the last 12-24 years (see Tables A-24 and A-1 in SEDAR 2011, respectively). <br/><br/>Projections of SSB for Gray Triggerfish in the Gulf of Mexico were generated using the 'Gulf-wide Shrimp Effort' model. Under each of three scenarios for which SSB was projected, SSB was expected to increase. Recovery periods under the no fishing scenario ranged from 3 to 4.5 years. However, there is concern that the trend of steadily declining recruitment and the low recruitment levels in recent years were not reflected in the model, which uses the estimated spawner-recruit relationship, and thus projections of recovery may be overly optimistic. The Allowable Biological Catch advice for 2012 and 2013 was based on the assumption that recruitment was at recent (2005-2009) levels, rather than based on the spawner-recruit relationship (SEDAR 2011); this was thought a more precautionary approach to Grey Triggerfish harvest. <br/><br/>Recreational landings in numbers of fish by state (Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida) and fishing mode were estimated for the period 1986-1998, landings peaked in 1990, followed by a steady decline. The majority of annual landings since 1986 have been reported from the West Coast of Florida, followed by Louisiana. Landings from the charter boat mode have dominated recreational landings most years. Landings in weight by year and state were estimated for the commercial sector for the period 1986-1998 with a trend similar to the recreational sector, but with a peak in 1993 followed by a steady decline. The greatest proportion of commercial landings has been reported for the west coast of Florida, followed by Louisiana. <br/>Southern Gulf of Mexico: Balistes capriscus is a minor commercial species along the Mexican coast in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is primarily utilized in small-scale artisanal fisheries (a more important commercial fishery for this species is along the Mexican Caribbean coast). Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations have declined in this region, but no quantitative data are available at this time. <br/><br/><strong>U.S. Atlantic coast</strong><br/>This species is not targeted by fisheries in this region (Kellison <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mean annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program during the fall and summer trawl surveys from 1987 to 2010 indicate no clear trend (NOAA unpub. data). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was greater in the 1970s (2.5% of catch) than in 2005-2006 (0.4% of catch) at specific capture site (210 Rock) in Onslow Bay, North Carolina (Ruderhausen et al. 2008). It is a dominant component within Sargassum off North Carolina (Casazza and Ross 2008). <br/><br/><strong>Brazil</strong><br/>In Brazil, it has been intensively caught in the industrial fleet over the past two decades. Total landings decreased by 10.5%, with landings from 1996-2005 at 29.64 t and from 2001-2005 at 26.54 t (Ataliba <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has been exploited off the state of São Paolo since the 1960s. In the past, it was included in the miscellaneous fish category, but in the last 15 years, it has become a very important fishery resource and is currently one of the most commonly caught commercial species (Bernardes 1988, Castro 2000). It was previously one of the most important species in the fisheries of Espirito Santo State, but overexploitation has since caused it to become commercially extinct (Freitas Netto and Di Beneditto 2010, Freitas Netto <em>et al</em>. in press). The use of gill nets may have caused the declines in population (Freitas Netto 2004). About 46% of the catches were composed of immature fishes, which increases the likelihood for growth overfishing to occur (Bernardes and Dias 2000, Bernardes 2001).<br/><br/>Landings by state changed substantially from 1986-2005. The majority of the landings came from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with generally lower landings from Santa Catarina and Rio de Grande Sul. Landings have declined by approximately 95% over 20 years in Sao Paulo and Rio de Grande Sul, while Santa Catarina has no trend, and landings increased by approximately 200% in Rio de Janeiro (Ataliba <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, increased landings in Brazil may be due to declines in more traditional fisheries (Ataliba <em>et al.</em> 2009) and therefore, may not clearly reflect the status of the population.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Atlantic</strong><br/>FAO capture production list annual Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic landings for this species from 1992-2009 as ranging from one tonne to 432 tonnes. Tunisia and Portugal have the highest catches from 1993-2009, with an average of 77 tonnes (1993-2009) and 66 tonnes (1999-2009), respectively (FAO 2014). Libya has the highest catch recorded in 2009 at 432 tonnes. Capture production for triggerfishes in the eastern central Atlantic show pronounced declines in catch in Ghana and Togo. Furthermore, declines in catches were also recorded for the Soviet Union from 1970-1989 in the divisions: Cape Verde, Sahara and Sherbro. In Ireland, there was an increase in triggerfish abundance between 1989-1991, with at least 184 specimens recorded, representing 53.6% of the total number of specimens documented (343) since the first record in 1845. Large numbers of specimens were reportedly sighted by SCUBA divers and captured on rod and line by anglers. It is unknown if the increase in triggerfish numbers represent a real change in the species overall abundance in Irish water or an increase in recording effort (Quigley <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/><em>Balistes capriscus</em> appears to be one of the most abundant near-bottom pelagic species occurring in the Sierra Leone waters. Results of two surveys conducted by the UNIDO/GEF Gulf of Guinea LME Project and FAO/NORAD in Moree, Ghana indicate that this species is one of the top 20 species encountered, indicating possible recovery of the stock of this species in Ghana (Koranteng 2000). In Cote-d'Ivoire, this species was very abundant from 1983-1986 during the hot season, but then disappeared from 1993 (there was no survey conducted between 1987 and 1992). There was apparently no link of the abundance of <em>B. capriscus</em> to the usual physical and biological environmental parameters. This was the opposite of the pattern that was observed in Ghana by Koranteng (1998), where species abundance was higher in colder regime and declined when waters warmed up (Joanny and Menard 2002).<br/><br/>In Ghana, from ~1973 and following a decline in the sardinella fishery in the western Gulf of Guinea, there was an increase in landings of this species (as <em>Balistes carolinensis</em>) in the Ghanian demersal fishery. In 1979-1980, the demersal component of triggerfish assessed in bottom trawl surveys was put at 99,000 t (or 57.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), or 62% of the total demersal fish biomass in Ghanian coastal waters (Koranteng and Pauly 2002). In May 1981-March 1982, the estimated biomass was between 314,000 and 500,000 t (Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982, Ofori-Adu 1987, 1994, Aggrey-Fynn 2007). Triggerfish catch drastically declined from 18,610 tonnes in 1986 to 2 tonnes in 1995 in Ghanaian waters, and recent report from CECAF capture production&#160; (FAO 2008) show that the annual catches of triggerfish show two separate peaks between 1972 and 2003. The first catch peak (12,563 tons) occurred in 1979, and the second peak (17,250 tons) in 1986/87. Before 1979, triggerfish catch levels were from 2 830 tons (1972) to 9,138 tons (1977). In between 1979 and 1986/87, triggerfish catch fell to ‘regular or stable’ annual levels (5,000–8,000 tons/year). After 1987, triggerfish catch experienced a ‘sharp’ decline in 1988 to 2,862 tons which continued to decline, indicating that inshore triggerfish catch generally increased with inshore effort. Inshore catch decreased dramatically from 1979-80 at relatively same effort and continued to decrease from 1980-84, catch increased in 1984-1986 at increased effort and decreased progressively with effort from 1987-91 (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). The triggerfish biomass was highest in 1985 and decreased afterwards up to 1991. The biomass decrease was quite significant from 1987-89 at virtually the same effort; and 1989-91 there was virtually no biomass of the triggerfish resource in Ghanaian coastal waters (Koranteng 1998, Aggrey-Fynn 2007).<br/><br/><em>Balistes capriscus</em> is an important economic resource in the Gulf of Guinea. It was recorded to have reached maximum abundance in the late 1970s to early 1980s in the Canary Current (Caverivière 1982, Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982). This species was the most abundant demersal/semi-pelagic species in the 1980s (Mensah and Quaatey 2002). At the time that this species dominated in the Gulf of Guinea ecosystem, it corresponded to a period of low temperature and high salinity, and a decrease in the total density of sciaenids, some lutjanids were also displaced by the expanding triggerfish population with the latter occupying the niche of the snappers (Koranteng 1998, Koranteng 2001, Koranteng and Pauly 2002). In 1982-1990, the <em>Balistes capriscus</em> stock declined and accounted for only 4% of the total catch of the species and the other groups in the sparid species assemblage in the Gulf of Guinea (Koranteng 2001a). This species dominated the Gulf of Guinea ecosystem, especially from Ghana to Sierra Leone, for nearly 20 years, displacing <em>Brachydeuterus auritus</em> as the most abundant species off Ghana. For reasons that have yet to be determined, triggerfish declined in abundance from ~1988, and only a few specimens were caught in surveys conducted in the 1990s (Koranteng and Pauly 2002). There are reported to be two separate stocks in the Gulf of Guinea with no apparent interchange- the eastern stock which occurred off Ghana and the western stock off Guinea Bissau and Guinea (Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982, Stromme 1983, Mensah and Quaatey 2002); both have almost disappeared (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). To address this gap, catch and biological data were obtained for this species was obtained from trawl surveys conducted in 2005 off the waters of Benin, Togo, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, results of the study indicate that the distributions of the Grey Triggerfish had not changed despite the decline documented for nearly two decades. Moreover, the depth distribution, modal size classes and growth were comparable to previous studies before the decline (Aggrey-Fynn 2009).<br/><br/>Grey Triggerfish exploitation ratio (0.2727) indicate that the triggerfish resource is underexploited as compared to the exploitation ratio of 0.67 derived from 1980 growth results of Gray Triggerfish (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). Thus, the triggerfish resource might not have been overexploited before their disappearance. Though current exploitation rates show an under-exploited fishery, the <em>Balistes</em> fishery has not revived in Ghana. Environmental forcing, specifically the intense cooling along the coast of Ghana in recent years and triggerfish migration from cold coastal waters to warm offshore waters, and the unusual minimum mean temperatures experienced in 1979 and 1987 that have not been recorded again in coastal waters of Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn 2007) may be impacting the populations.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Prior to 1994, skate captures were less than 1,000t, however, since that year skate landings increased considerably, reaching &gt;15,000 t in 2001 and 17,465 t in 2003 (Massa <em>et al</em>. 2004). Among the species of rays exploited commercially is <em>B. brachyurops</em> (García de la Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2000).   <br/> <br/><strong>Falkland Islands</strong> <br/><em>Bathyraja brachyurops</em> is one of the dominant species in the multi-species skate trawl fishery around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands which has been operating since 1989. The fishery initially operated over two main areas, one located on the shelf edge to the north of the Islands, and the other to the south of the Islands. Following heavy fishing pressure during the early 1990s, Agnew <em>et al</em>. (2000), found that the species composition of the catch had changed so that the larger, late-maturing <em>B. griseocauda</em> had been replaced as the dominant species in the catch by <em>B. albomaculata</em> to the north and <em>B. brachyurops</em> to the south. Agnew <em>et al.</em> (2000) suggested that <em>B. brachyurops</em> should be able to sustain higher fishing pressure than the larger and late-maturing species in the fishery. <br/> <br/>In 1996, following these declines, the southern area (south of 52°S) was closed to the fleet and the fishery now operates north of the Islands. A more recent assessment of the northern ray population (Wakeford <em>et al</em>. 2004) indicated that there was no significant increasing or decreasing trend in the CPUE for <em>B. brachyurops</em> over the period from 1992 to 2001. <br/> <br/>The Falkland/Malvinas Islands have in place a precautionary management system for the skate fishery (see Conservation Actions), and together with the recovery of biomass (Agnew <em>et al</em>. 2000), what this means is that the fishery will continue into the future, because overall stocks are stable or recovering. <br/> <br/>There have been no studies to determine the abundance of this species in the southern area since the rajid fishery closure. However, this species is also caught as bycatch by finfish trawlers operating around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and within the southern rajid closure, targeting <em>Micromesistius australis, Macruronus magellanicus, Merluccius hubbsi, M. australis</em> and <em>Salilota australis</em> (Brickle<em> et al</em>. 2003). While vessels fishing under general finfish licenses are prohibited from targeting rajids, a small bycatch (below 10%) is allowed and rajids to the south of the Islands are continuing to face bycatch fishing pressure. <br/> <br/><strong>Chile</strong> <br/><em>Bathyraja brachyurops</em> is also a regular bycatch of the <em>Dipturus chilensis</em> longlining fishery off Chile (Lamilla <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2002) which operates mainly at depths from 30 to 300m. Landings for the fishery comprise 85% <em>D. chilensis</em> and 10% <em>D. trachydermus</em> with the remaining 5% made up of <em>Bathyraja albomaculata, B. brachyurops, B. griseocauda</em> and <em>Rajella sadowskii</em> (Lamilla <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2002). Overall biomass of the target species (<em>D. chilensis</em> and <em>D. trachydermus</em>) has declined by 51% since fishing began in 1979 (Quiroz 2005) and declines are thus also likely to have occurred for bycatch species. There may be some refuge for <em>B. brachyurops</em> at greater depths where fishing does not occur. However, there is also an artisanal Patagonian toothfish longline fishery operating at depths of 300 to 2,500 m between Iquique (20°S) to Ladrillero Gulf (49°S) off Chile (Lamilla 2003). This species could potentially be caught as bycatch in the fishery.","<strong>Argentina</strong> <br/>There are theoretically TACs, minimum sizes and overall annual quotas for quite a number of elasmobranch species in Argentina, however, little attention is paid to these and there is no regular monitoring by authorities (M. Stehmann pers. obs. 2006). Species-specific assessments of direct and indirect catches are a priority. <br/> <br/><strong>Falkland/Malvinas Islands</strong> <br/>The following information is taken from Agnew <em>et al</em>. (1999 and 2000) unless otherwise specified. <br/> <br/>The Falkland/Malvinas Islands multispecies skate fishery is managed by limiting fishing effort. The effort that each vessel is likely to exert is calculated (based on size, duration of license and past fishing history) and since 1994 only a limited number of licenses are granted to ensure that the total allowable effort (determined from assessments of stock status) is not exceeded. Stock status assessments are not, however, species-specific and a sustainable total allowable effort for the entire stock may not translate to sustainable levels of effort for individual species. <br/> <br/>Following declines in CPUE in the early 1990s, in 1996, the southern area (below 52°S) was closed to rajid fishing and the fishery is now resticted to the area north of the Islands. This closure is extended to 50°30´S (between 56°30W and 58°W) during the second season of each year to exclude the skate fishing fleet from <em>Loligo gahi</em> fishing grounds. <br/> <br/>All licensed vessels are required to provide daily catch and effort details, including discards of commercial and non-commercial species to the Falkland Island Fisheries Department. There is, however, no requirement to report species-specific information. Scientific observers are deployed onboard skate vessels in order to quantify the catch composition by species and to obtain detailed biological data on individual species. <br/> <br/>Vessels fishing under general finfish licences are prohibited from targeting rajids, although a small bycatch (below 10%) is allowed. <br/> <br/><strong>Chile</strong> <br/>In Chile, since 2005, there has been an annual quota for <em>Dipturus</em> spp. caught south of 41°28'S. Each year, there is also a seasonal fishery closure for the entire Chilean coast between December 1 and February 28 to protect the reproductive season. It is unknown whether this measure also protects the reproductive season of <em>B. griseocauda</em>.",Unknown,"The population size is unknown, however, this species is the third most important in the rajid trawl fishery north of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands forming around 20% of the catch (Wakeford <em>et al</em>. 2004). 
<br/>
<br/>This fishery initially operated in two areas, one to the north and one to the south of the islands. Following heavy fishing pressure during the early 1990s, Agnew <em>et al</em>.

The southern area has since been closed to the rajid fishery and there have been no studies on the status of <em>B. brachyurops</em> in this area since.

The effort that each vessel is likely to exert is calculated (based on size, duration of license and past fishing history) and since 1994 only a limited number of licenses are granted to ensure that the total allowable effort (determined from assessments of stock status) is not exceeded. Stock status assessments are not, however, species-specific and a sustainable total allowable effort for the entire stock may not translate to sustainable levels of effort for individual species. <br/> <br/>Following declines in CPUE in the early 1990s, in 1996, the southern area (below 52°S) was closed to rajid fishing and the fishery is now resticted to the area north of the Islands. This closure is extended to 50°30´S (between 56°30W and 58°W) during the second season of each year to exclude the skate fishing fleet from <em>Loligo gahi</em> fishing grounds. All licensed vessels are required to provide daily catch and effort details, including discards of commercial and non-commercial species to the Falkland Island Fisheries Department. There is, however, no requirement to report species-specific information. Scientific observers are deployed onboard skate vessels in order to quantify the catch composition by species and to obtain detailed biological data on individual species. <br/> <br/>Vessels fishing under general finfish licenses are prohibited from targeting rajids, although a small bycatch (below 10%) is allowed.",Unknown,Population size unknown.,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

Longlining for Patagonian Toothfish initiated in the area in the late 1980s and early 1990s to allow exploitation of older, mature fish in areas where trawls could not be used (MCS 2007). Longlining is now the principle method used to capture Patagonian Toothfish in this area (around South Georgia and the associated plateau to the west around Shag Rocks, CCAMLR sub-area 48.3), although trawls still operate around some other sub-Antarctic islands outside the area of this fishery (MCS 2007).

Although this area is too deep for conventional trawling, two licensed longlining vessels targeting Patagonian toothfish operate in this area (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 1999). These vessels are prohibited from targeting skates but are allowed a small bycatch below 10% of the total catch (J. Pompert pers. obs. 2008) (see Conservation Measures below). Of the skate bycatch in this longline fishery, <em>B. meridionalis</em> is one of the most commonly caught species (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 1999). Catches are reported grouped with other <em>Bathyraja</em> species, as well as a large unidentified skate species that occurs in the area (Amblyraja cf. georgiana), although information on the species captured is available from on-board observers. Total annual catch of skates in this fishery during 2007 (Jan–Dec) was 42 t (including <em>B. papilionifera, B. meridionalis, </em>and <em>Amblyraja cf. georgiana </em>combined) (FIFD unpublished data). Previously, skates were generally discarded, but recently (since about June 2007) these vessels started to retain them for export to Korean markets (J. Pompert pers. obs. 2008).","The CCAMLR Working Group recommend that, where possible, all skates should be cut from the line while still in the water, except on the request of observers, and that areas with high bycatch rates should be avoided by Patagonian Toothfish fisheries.<br/><br/><strong>South Georgia</strong><br/>No species-specific management measures are in place for <em>B. meridionalis</em>, however, this species may benefit from the following general measures and research in this area: The South Georgia Toothfish fishery was certified by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) in 2004 and an assessment of the fishery is expected to conclude in 2009. Assessment of the impact of fishing on skate populations is a condition of this certification and it is anticipated that preliminary advice on assessments for skates will begin in 2008 (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2007). This should include information on IUU fishing effort estimates.

Choat pers. comm.). Spearfishing at night has reduced the numbers of <em>B. muricatum</em> (Gladstone 1986, D. Fenner pers. comm. on 27th July 2006). <br/> <br/>In Roviana Lagoon (Solomon Islands), artisanal spear fishers use their sophisticated indigenous knowledge of the spawning behaviour and ecology of <em>B. muricatum</em> to catch as many fish as possible in a night (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>The belief that <em>B. muricatum</em> predominantly aggregate at night around the new moon period and that catch rates are far greater during the new moon was not supported by field survey done in 2000-2001 (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>Dulvy and Polunin (2004) suggested that the decline of <em>B. muricatum</em> in the Lau Group in Fiji was mainly due its nocturnal aggregative behaviour in shallow lagoon water or in reef caves and the daytime foraging of shoals in depth accessible by spearfishermen. <br/> <br/><em>B. muricatum</em> was often captured for ceremonial events, indicating this species has a high cultural significant value in the Lau Island group, Fiji (Dulvy and Polunin 2004). <br/> <br/>Low priority to enforcing legislation related to spearfishing in Fiji (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>In 2001, the Samoa Fisheries Projected reported that SCUBA spearfishing activities at night had been increased rapidly in the past 12 months, in which <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the target species (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Gillett and Moy (2006) pointed out that sleeping <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the three main types of fish to be targeted by spearfishing.<br/><br/>Parrotfishes show varying degrees of habitat preference and utilization  of coral reef habitats, with some species spending the majority of their  life stages on coral reefs, while others primarily utilize seagrass  beds, mangroves, algal beds, and /or rocky reefs. Although the majority  of the parrotfishes occur in mixed habitat (primarily inhabiting  seagrass beds, mangroves, and rocky reefs) approximately 78% of these  mixed habitat species are experiencing greater than 30% loss of coral  reef area and habitat quality across their distributions. Of those  species that occur exclusively in coral reef habitat, more than 80% are  experiencing a greater than 30% of coral reef loss and degradation  across their distributions. However, more research is needed to  understand the long-term effects of habitat loss and degradation on  these species populations. Widespread coral reef loss and declining  habitat conditions are particularly worrying for species that depend on  live coral reefs for food and shelter especially as studies have shown  that protection of pristine habitats facilitate the persistence of adult  populations in species that have spatially separated adult and juvenile  habitats. Furthermore, coral reef loss and declining habitat conditions  are particularly worrying for some corallivorous excavating  parrotfishes that play major roles in reef dynamics and sedimentation  (Comeros-Raynal <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2012).<strong></strong>","Two marine protected areas (MPAs) [""""no-take"""" zones] were established in Baraulu Village and Nusa Hope Village, Solomon Islands in 2002 to protect <em>B. muricatum</em> and other lagoon species (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>There are no direct protective practices for <em>B. muricatum</em>. <br/> <br/><strong>Fiji</strong> <br/>The Fisheries (Restrictions on Use of Breathing (Apparatus) Regulations, 1997 ban the use of underwater breathing apparatus to """"collect, take, or dive for fish"""", except for those with appointment from the Permanent Secretary or any person appointed by him in writing.  And the Sixth Schedule of the Fisheries Regulation establishes minimum sizes for 21 tpes of fish, including many that are often caught by spearfishing (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Besides, traditional fisheries rules (e.g,. a ban on night diving, and a ban on the use of SCUBA for fishing) in most of the 410 traditional fishing areas in Fiji have their own local fishing rules and many of those are applicable to spearfishing (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/><strong>Samoa</strong> <br/>The Fishing (Scuba Fishing) Regulations 2003 states no person shall scuba fish without a license (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Many different types of traditional rules (e.g., establishing small protected areas, minimun size limits, and restricting the use of underwater torches for spearfishing at night) governing fisheries exist in the 324 villages of Samoa (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/><strong>Solomon Islands</strong> <br/>Regulations 29 of the Fisheries Act, which enacted in January 2004, states """"any person using under-water breathing apparatus for the purpose of harvesting any marine resource shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars or six months imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment"""" (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Many villages regulate spearfishing (e.g. bans on night diving) by themselves (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Although traditional leader's ability to manage marine resource was found to be effective in some of the tribes in Solomon Islands, the existence of non-member (e.g., institutional context) and enforcement of harvest restriction rules are crucial so as to enhance management and minimize the public contest over natural resources (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>Russ and Alcala (1998) suggested that the small size of most marine protected areas in heavily fished regions would show little positive effects on parrotfish abundances. <br/> <br/>Aswani and Hamilton (2004) suggested that the prohibition on spearfishing within passage habitats in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, would provide a measure of protection the remaining important spawning stocks of <em>B. muricatum</em> in the Indo Pacific region. <br/> <br/>Aswani and Hamilton (2004) recommended that any lunar ban on spearfishing should focus at late full moon quarter during which <em>B. muricatum</em> spawns.",Decreasing,"<em>B. muricatum</em> are locally patchily distributed, adults always found in small shoals (&lt;= 40 individuals) (Donaldson and Dulvy 2004). <br/> <br/>Choat and Randall (1986) stated <em>B. muricatum</em> does not display sex-associated patterns of colour change, maintaining a uniform body colouration in adult females and males.

Based on limited data from Nigeria, Cameroon, Equitorial Guinea and Sao Tome, this species was also considered to be overexploited (CECAF 2011). In summary, based on biomass, catch and effort, this species is considered overexploited in the majority of its range. Based on CPUE summarized in CECAF 2011 (and data provided by Williams pers. comm. 2013), there has been approximately 50% decline in CPUE in Togo, Benin, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire coastal trawlers&#160;(from about 250 to 100 between 1990 and 2006), with no real trend in artisanal fisheries (average of about 100) from these same countries.

In Mauritania, it is not directly targeted, but in the southern portion of the country it is taken as bycatch in trawls. In Senegal, it is primarily taken by artisanal fisheries, including beach seine. In Nigeria, this species is primarily caught as by-catch in shrimp fisheries as well as artisanal.&#160;Data through the early parts of the last decade indicate that exploitation is occurring in this fishery. The human population is increasing and food supplies remain scarce in this area, and therefore, we can only conclude that effort is increasing further.&#160;Yield per recruit analysis showed that excessive fishing effort was being exerted on stocks and a very low length at first capture was observed.

However, present rates of harvesting do not appear to be a substantial threat to the population.","The Gulf menhaden reduction fishery is one of the largest fisheries by volume in the United States and has been successfully managed under a regional Fishery Management Plan (FMP) since 1978. States have common regulations for fishing season duration, which traditionally lasts from April through early November. States manage quotas which are in place for commercial harvest by all gears combined. Each state has its own designation of closed or restricted areas to purse-seine fishing. Bycatch regulations vary by state. &#160;Quantitative analyses of Gulf menhaden began in the early 1970s (SEDAR 2013).&#160;Detailed information on the history of the Gulf menhaden fishery is provided in VanderKooy and Smith (2002).",Stable,"This species can be locally common.

Therefore, for the purposes of this assessment, reported landings (FAO  2016) and reconstructed catches (Pauly and Zeller 2015) have been  combined for <em>Brevoortia aurea </em>and <em>Brevoortia pectinata</em> and will be applied to both species as an estimate of change over time.<em> </em><em></em>  <p>Globally, landings of <em>B. aurea </em>and <em>B. pectinata </em>reported  to the FAO averaged approximately 3,000 tonnes annually between 1950  and 2014 and are driven by landings from Brazil (FAO 2016). Smaller  quantities (&lt;1,000 tonnes) are reported from Argentina and Uruguay  (FAO 2016). Overall, there has been an increase in reported landings  with a 4-fold fluctuation throughout the time series. The reported  landings show two prominent peaks during the years 1973 (11,400 tonnes)  and 1995 (11,500 tonnes), and one intermediate peak in 1986 (9,800  tonnes). Current reported landings have declined by 72% following the  highest peak in 1995 (11,500 tonnes), and have approached historical  landings (1950) of approximately 500 tonnes.

The population extends as far north as the Gulf of Maine; however, its occurrence there fluctuates tremendously on an annual basis, from periods of great abundance to periods of scarcity or compete absence (ASFMC 2011).<br/><br/>The 2015 benchmark stock assessment improved the quality of data used to conduct the 2009 assessment. This included improved knowledge of the age composition of the stock, natural mortality, and the development of a coastwide abundance index. Fishing mortality has been decreasing throughout the history of the fishery and is now 91% below the threshold for overfishing and 73% below the target. The highest fishing mortalities for the northern commercial reduction fishery were estimated to have occurred in the 1950s, and in the south it peaked during the 1970s to 1990s. The highest fishing mortalities for the northern commercial bait fishery were estimated to have occurred in the 1950s and 1990s, and in the south it occurred during the late 1990s and early 2000s (SEDAR40 2015). Biomass was estimated to have been largest during the late-1950s and late-2000s, with lows occurring during the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, and was relatively stable through much of the 1970s and 1980s. Estimated biomass peaked in 1958 with 2,284 thousands of metric tons and the low occurred at&#160;667 thousands of mt in 1997 (71% decline over 40 years).&#160;The&#160;number of older fish at age, weight at age and population fecundity has increased in recent years, which is likely causing biomass to increase at a faster rate than abundance (SEDAR40 2015).&#160;The 2015 stock assessment concluded that this fishery is neither overfished, nor experiencing overfishing and the stock is below the current fishing mortality target (SEDAR40 2015). Three generation lengths is equal to approximately 20 years and therefore, the time series of estimated biomass from 1994-2013 was used for this assessment. Over this time period, biomass increased by 45% (calculated using endpoints of the data in SEDAR40 2015 page 57 Table 7.2.3.3).

The precautionary TAC was set based on 50-75% of the total landings from 2007–2009 which peaked at over 83,400 t in 2009.

In addition, a catch rule ceiling of 5% bycatch was implemented where <em>C. aper</em>&#160;is taken with other TAC controlled species (O'Donnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;<strong><strong><br/></strong><br/></strong>",Unknown,"<em>Capros aper </em>is abundant in parts of its range including the Seine Seamount and Great Meteor Seamount in the Eastern Atlantic (Fock <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Christiansen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). This species was historically rare in the Northeastern Atlantic but from the 1970s onward, the abundance of this species increased exponentially and its distribution expended northwards along the western seaboard of Ireland and Bay of Biscay Blanchard and Vandermeirsch 2005). Abundance increased particularly between the 1980s and 2000s in the Bay of Biscay, over the Galician continental shelf, and in the Celtic Sea and is now a dominant species in the Bay of Biscay (Blanchard and Vandermeirsch 2005, Hussy<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2012). This species was caught more frequently and in larger quantities in both pelagic and demersal fisheries. During this time, several landings were produced into fishmeal in Ireland but this was short lived due to logistical problems because of the prominent dorsal spines on this species and was not favoured by processors. In the 1990s, interest peaked again when Dutch pelagic vessels landed frozen samples to determine if it could be marketed for human consumption. Irish landings of this species was relatively small in the early 2000s at less than 700 mt per year and it was not until 2006 when a directed fishery fully developed. The fishery for <em>Capros aper</em>&#160;eventually bridged an important gap between the short season fisheries for horse mackerel, mackerel and blue whiting and effectively extended the fishing season for the RSW fleet from late August through May (O'Donnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

There is a recommendation to not increase the effort in this fishery and to generate species-specific regulations and management plans, including minimum catch size and adjusting fishing gear to avoid juvenile occurrence in the catch (SAGARPA 2012).<br/><br/>In U.S. waters, landings in the <em>C. hippos</em> commercial fishery fluctuated from 1974 to 1995. In 1974, total landings were 950 t and peaked in 1990 at 1,748 t. Between 1994 to 1995, landings declined from 850 t to 175 t. In 2013, 106 t were landed. Between 1974-2013 (39 years), this represents a 89% decline in landings. This decline was due to a regulation change in the fishery implemented in 1995, which banned trammel nets, gill nets, and purse seines. Since 1995, the landings have remained stable at around 200 t (past 18 years). <em>Caranx latus</em> usually occurs further offshore than <em>C. hippo</em>s and is therefore not targeted.&#160; Commercial landings are insignificant.<br/><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The number of pelagic sharks landed by fishing fleets in all oceans has increased in economic importance (Mejuto <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, catch statistics are generally not available (Holts 1988, Smith <em>et al</em>. 1998) and where they are, they are under-reported. The Silvertip Shark is one of the nine main species landed by high seas longline and net fleets. The majority of these fleets target tunas in all of the world's oceans and as a result have a large bycatch of pelagic sharks (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005); for example, the species is a known bycatch of western Pacific tuna fleets (Ward <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Silvertip Shark was not considered in Clarke <em>et al</em>.'s (2006a) analysis of the global shark fin trade, although fins of the species have been identified in the trade (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006b).<br/><br/>Coral reef-associated species such as the Silvertip Shark are important to fisheries in Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the Maldives, and Chagos Archipelago (500 km south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean), where reefs dominate coastal habitats (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). In this region elasmobranchs are most commonly taken as bycatch in non-target fisheries or catchall artisanal fisheries (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Finning and discarding of carcasses has been reported, especially in offshore and high seas fisheries targeting tuna (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). The Silvertip Shark from the Chagos Archipelago is taken by the Mauritian Inshore Fishery, which targets grouper (subfamily Epinephelinae) and the Deepwater Snapper (<em>Etelis carbunculus</em>) and has operated in these waters since the early 1970s (Mees 1996). There is also an open-water fishery targeting tuna that commonly catches reef-associated sharks incidentally (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). Despite conservation measures in place in the Chagos Archipelago (see the <em>Conservation</em> section), illegal fishing is suspected to be a common activity in remote locations.<br/><br/>The Silvertip Shark is landed in local markets in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, and the Philippines (Kumoru 2003, SEAFDEC 2006, White 2007). In the Philippines, it is in the top 10 most landed species by number (0.73%) and weight (2.6%) with individuals ranging in size from 210-240 cm TL and averaging 23 kg in weight (SEAFDEC 2006). In Papua New Guinea, the Silvertip Shark was taken in the longline shark fishery that operated close to seamounts and non-emergent reefs (Kumoru 2003). Based on observer data, the Silky Shark (<em>C. falciformis</em>) and the Oceanic Whitetip Shark (<em>C. longimanus</em>) dominated the shark catch (58%), but the Silvertip Shark (6.2%) was also taken in significant numbers (Kumoru 2003). Most Silvertip Shark individuals caught in this fishery were retained (88%) and the fins and meat marketable (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the Western and Central Pacifc Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark.<br/><br/>There is evidence from northern Australia that finning can cause localised depletion of shark populations. Remote populations of Silky Shark are likely highly sensitive to target fisheries for meat or fins, particularly given their limited dispersal and localised movement patterns (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Acoustic and baited camera survey techniques were used to census shark abundance at two northern Australian reefs: Mermaid Reef in Rowley Shoals (a Commonwealth Marine Protected Area closed to all fishing) and Scott Reef (within the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] 1974 Box in the Timor Sea, where access by Indonesian fishers using traditional artisanal fishing techniques is permitted). Shark abundance was an order of magnitude higher on Mermaid Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). The Silvertip Shark, the main target of shark finning fleets in this area, was common on Mermaid Reef and absent at Scott Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). Fishing pressure is the most plausible explanation for differences in the composition and abundance of shark assemblages between Mermaid and Scott Reefs. Sharks preferentially targeted by fishermen, such as hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna</em> spp.) and the Silvertip Shark were absent from counts at Scott Reef. Furthermore, catches of reef sharks in the local area (MOU74 Box) declined throughout the early 1990s to the point that Indonesian shark fishing vessels have become relatively uncommon in this area (Wallner and McLoughlin 1996, Fox and Sen 2002, Ruppert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Several initiatives are underway to identify which species are being taken and in what quantities.<br/><br/>In the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia, the Silvertip Shark is not targeted by fisheries, but very low numbers are taken incidentally by commercial and recreational line fisheries that target Coral Trout (<em>Plectropomus leopardus</em>; Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009). This may be a result of its strong diel and foraging behaviours around coral reefs at night when little fishing activity occurs (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2015). Conversely, poor reporting of species-specific shark landings may occur (Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009), a common pattern observed in many fisheries where untargeted elasmobranch bycatch typically goes unidentified and/or unreported (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2002). In addition, although most of the shark catch associated with the Coral Trout line fishery is not retained, sharks that interact with line fisheries may break off before landing or are released bearing hooks and traces, and it is unclear how this may affect the health and survival of Silvertip Sharks (Gallagher <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, catch-per-unit effort data from the period between 1989 and 2006 showed no evidence of increase or decline of sharks associated with the line fishery along the GBR (Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Silvertip Shark is not known to interact with the inshore gillnet fishery that operates in Queensland waters (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>A ten-year survey (2000–2010) using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire GBR showed that the Silvertip Shark was the second most commonly sighted species (12.2%) (Espinoza et al. 2014). This survey showed that the species is restricted to offshore coral reef habitats in the GBR. An examination of the GBR Marine Park Zoning showed higher abundances of the Silvertip Shark in reefs that were closed to fishing. Moreover, higher abundances of the species were observed in protected areas that had more and healthier coral cover, suggesting that the loss and degradation of coral reefs may negatively affect their populations (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014). BRUVS data from 2004-2010 suggest that the abundance of the Silvertip Shark has not changed since the new re-zoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004, despite an increase in the coverage of protected areas (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>Currently there are no species-specific management measures in place.&#160;In the Chagos Archipelago, since 2006 all fishing vessels were required to report shark bycatch, finning practices were banned, and the use of wire trace was prohibited. There was also a British Indian Ocean Patrol Vessel patrolling this Archipelago to detect illegal shark fisheries, mainly from Sri Lanka (Anderson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). However, illegal fisheries still operate in these areas as these measures are largely unenforced. Catch levels should be quantified and monitored throughout the range of the species. Silvertip Shark populations in isolated coral reef habitats subject to fishing pressure may benefit from creation of Marine Protected Areas, because their limited dispersal from those habitats likely makes them more susceptible to depletion (Compagno&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Barnett <em>et al.</em> 2012). Enforcement of regulations related to fisheries catch and landings, such as finning regulations and size limits, would be the most beneficial conservation measure for the species.  </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Silvertip Shark population appears to be fragmented with apparently low potential for interchange between localised stocks.&#160;Surveys of fish markets in Indonesia and Papua Guinea suggest that the Silvertip Shark has undergone large population declines in those waters (W. White, CSIRO, 02/2015, pers. comm). For example, a five-year survey of Indonesian fish landing sites only found 95 Silvertip Shark individuals out of a total of more than 21,000 sharks recorded (White 2007). Based on diving survey data, Graham <em>et al</em>. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks observed per dive in Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a decline of over 90% across 36 years. Species-specific data only included the period from 1996 to 2006, in which the mean number of the Silvertip Shark observed per dive actually increased from 0.03 sharks per dive to 0.12 (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, underwater surveys conducted between 2004 and 2010 across a much broader area of the Central Western Pacific Ocean, that is, around 46 United States Pacific Islands, estimated that common reef sharks have declined to 3-10% of baseline levels around inhabited islands (Nadon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Baseline was considered to be the absence of humans (Nadon <em>et al.</em> 2012) and theoretically could be considered to be at least three generation lengths of Silvertip Sharks (66 years). Given this large decline in the abundance of reef shark species around inhabited islands and the high exploitation levels from fisheries operating in the Indo-Pacific region, it is suspected that the Silvertip Shark have experienced population reductions of more than 30% across the Indo-Pacific Ocean over three generations.</p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

It is also taken by bottom trawl and pelagic longline but only forms a minor component of the catch in these fisheries (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 1989, Parry-Jones 1996, Amorim <em>et al.</em> 1998, Marín <em>et al.</em> 1998, Bagley <em>et al.</em> 2000).  <br/> <br/><em>C. brachyurus</em> is fished commercially in New Zealand (Francis 1998, Bagley <em>et al.</em> 2000, Ministry of Fisheries catch effort data), Australia (Cappo 1992), South Africa (Compagno <em>et al.</em>1989), Brazil (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 1998), Uruguay (Marín <em>et al.</em> 1998), Argentina (Chiaramonte 1998a, b), Mexico (Appelgate <em>et al.</em> 1993) and China (Parry-Jones 1996). <em>C. brachyurus</em> was not reported in trade from any of its Mediterranean range states by Rose (1996) but it is taken in net fisheries here and is usually lumped with other Carcharhinids (e.g., <em>C. plumbeus</em>) when landed (Fergusson and Compagno 1995). Little data is available for these fisheries. In Western Australia the """"bronze whaler fishery"""" actually targets juvenile dusky shark (<em>C. obscurus</em>) (Heald 1987, Simpfendorfer 2001). <em>C. brachyurus</em> only constitutes about 3% of total reported landings in this fishery (R. McAuley pers. comm.). <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. are also taken as bycatch in the Southern Shark Fishery (Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia). Between 1996-2001 mean annual landed catch of <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. in this fishery was 71.5 tonnes (range 44-106 tonnes) (T. Walker pers. comm). The bulk of this (97-100%) was landed in South Australia, where  landings increased from less than 20 tonnes a year in the early 1980s to 60-70 tonnes a year between 1988 and 1990 (Stevens in Castro <em>et al.</em> 1999). During the 1990s the landed catch has remained stable at around 70 tonnes a year, although a maximum of 105 tonnes was landed in 1999 (T. Walker pers. com.). The species composition of the bronze whaler catch in South Australia is unknown but is likely to be predominately <em>C. brachyurus</em> (Cappo 1992). In New Zealand reported commercial landings increased from 10 tonnes in 1989/90 to about 48 tonnes in 1995/96. Since then landings have declined steadily to about 20 tonnes in the 2001/02 fishing year (Ministry of Fisheries catch effort data). Most of the catch is taken by set net in the Hauraki Gulf and Firth of Thames. Reported landings from this area have been declining since 1992/93. No CPUE analysis of this fishery has been performed so it is uncertain if the decline in landings represents a decline in abundance or a change in fishing practice.   <br/> <br/>Although no fishery data is available for <em>C. brachyurus</em> in East Asia (i.e., Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, East China Sea) directed shark fisheries have operated in the region since at least the 1950s, and sharks are a component of multi-species fisheries for more highly valued species such as tuna and swordfish (Parry-Jones and others in Phipps 1996). All directed fisheries for large coastal sharks in this region appear to have ceased during the 1970s due to declining catches and a shift in effort into offshore fisheries for tuna and salmon (Parry-Jones, and Kiyono in Phipps 1996). Parry-Jones (1996) observed that shark landings from coastal fisheries in China consisted mainly of small immature sharks (i.e., 90% &lt;100 cm total length and 1 kg weight). The only <em>C. brachyurus</em> observed in markets during that survey was a juvenile weighing 5.5 kg in Fujian Province. Fishers from Fujian Province reported that large sharks were relatively common during the 1960s but are seldom caught now (Parry-Jones 1996). Fishing vessels from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Viet Nam all operate in the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea (Parry-Jones 1996). <em>C. brachyurus</em> is not reported to be an important component of Taiwan's shark fishery, either within Taiwanese waters, its distant-water shark fishing areas in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Mozambique, or its tuna longline and trawler fleets. The latter fishes waters of the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, India and northwest Africa (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2002).  <br/> <br/>In Argentina the main commercial fishery is located at Necochea. Reported annual landings range from 0 to 336 sharks (Chiaramonte 1998a). Chiaramonte (1998a) reported only two vessels targeted <em>C. brachyurus</em>, and observed that catches indicated this species was not sufficiently abundant to support a directed fishery should the school shark (<em>G. galeus</em>) stock collapse. In Chile directed shark fisheries are confined to the northern part of the country where artisanal fishers target shortfin mako (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>) and blue shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) and may occasionally take <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. (I. Kong pers. com.). Little information is available on the elasmobranch fisheries in Peru other than landings are dominated by smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus</em> spp) and batoids (Bonfil 1994). In 1990/91 landings crashed from over 25,000 tonnes to about 5,000 tonnes p.a. The reason for this crash is unknown and may not reflect a collapse of the fishery (Bonfil 1994). Mexican shark fisheries are the largest in America and the Pacific coast contributes about 60% of total landings (Bonfil 1994). There is also a significant bycatch of elasmobranchs in large scale trawl fisheries in the Mexican Pacific (Bonfil 1994). The Gulf of California represents one of the major fishing grounds in the Pacific and supports directed fisheries for <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. (<em>C. altimus, C. brachyurus, C. falciformis, C. leucus, C. limbatus, C. obscurus, C. porosus</em>) (Appelgate <em>et al.</em> 1993, Bonfil 1994). Although information on stock size and species specific fishing mortality was limited or non-existent Bonfil (1994) considered it likely, given the level of exploitation that many shark stocks in the Gulf of California were close to their maximum sustainable yield or overfished. Neither Applegate <em>et al.</em> (1993) or Bonfil (1994) listed <em>C. brachyurus</em> as being heavily fished. However, as it is vulnerable to the same types of gear and may be naturally less abundant than those <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. that dominate the landings, the effects of fishing on <em>C. brachyurus</em> may be more serious than its representation in the catch suggests. <em>C. brachyurus</em> and other <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. are rare in California and do not support any directed fisheries (Bonfil 1994, Hanson 1999, R. Lea pers. comm., D. Ebert pers. comm., G. Cailliet pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Sport fisheries taking <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. occur in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Mexico and California (Stevens 1984, Compagno <em>et al.</em> 1989, Cappo 1992, Pepperell 1992, Appelgate <em>et al.</em> 1993, Francis 1998, Chiaramonte 1998a, b). In New Zealand <em>C. brachyurus</em> is the most commonly landed <em>Carcharhinus</em> species. It is only infrequently taken by anglers targeting marlin and swordfish off the northeast North Island. Most of these fish are unwanted and are released. However there is a small summer boat and shore-based sport fishery for <em>C. brachyurus</em> centered on the large harbours in the northern North Island. Most of the sharks taken in this fishery are pregnant and post-partum females and are tagged and released. A small number are retained and landed during fishing competitions. <em>C. brachyurus</em> are also occasionally taken by bow-hunters in some North Island harbours, and there are incidental catches of juveniles and adults in recreational gill net fisheries for rig (<em>Mustelus lenticulatus</em>), mullet, snapper and flatfish. The size of this bycatch is unknown but is probably minor. <em>C. brachyurus</em> is a minor component of sport fishing catches in southern New South Wales between Port Stephens and Narooma but is likely to dominate """"bronze whaler"""" catches in Victoria and South Australia (Stevens 1984, Cappo 1992).  No information on these fisheries was available at the time of writing. In South Africa this species is regularly taken by shore-based fishers in the Eastern Cape. These fishers take mainly neonates and juveniles less than 2 m total length (Smale 1991).  There is also a land-based tag and release fishery for adult <em>C. brachyurus</em> in Nambia (S. Fowler pers. comm.). <br/> <br/><em>C. brachyurus</em> is commonly taken in protective shark control programs off Natal, South Africa and presumably Australia (New South Wales), although catches of <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. are not identified to species in Australia (Cliff and Dudley 1992, Reid and Krogh 1992, Dudley 1997, Dudley <em>et al.</em> 1998). The mean annual catch in the Natal shark nets between 1978 and 1990 was 138 (range 9 to 421). Large annual fluctuations in catch meant no trend was evident over that period (Cliff and Dudley 1992). <em>C. brachyurus</em> is also killed as a pest species in and around fish farms, notably southern bluefin tuna pens in South Australia (I.G. pers. obs). The shallow coastal nursery areas of <em>C. brachyurus</em> are also potentially vulnerable to habitat loss and pollution arising from coastal development. The effects of this are likely to be greatest in parts of the Mediterranean Sea and East Asia. Expansion of marine aquaculture in New Zealand also potentially threatens nursery areas of <em>C. brachyurus</em>. <br/> <br/>Castro <em>et al.</em> (1999) listed this species as Category 3 (i.e., a species that is exploited by directed fisheries or bycatch, and has a limited reproductive potential, and/or life history characteristics that makes it especially vulnerable to over fishing). Vidthayanon (2002) listed it as vulnerable in Thailand.","<strong>Australia:</strong> <br/>A prohibition on taking school and gummy sharks in shark nursery areas in Tasmania, and bans on gillnetting in some of these, may indirectly benefit some <em>C. brachyurus</em> but most of these areas are outside the main part of the species range (Williams and Schaap 1992, Last and Stevens 1994). Victorian coastal waters out to three nautical miles are almost completely closed to commercial shark fishing (Stevens 2002). <br/> <br/><strong>New Zealand:</strong> <br/><em>C. brachyurus</em> may not be target fished in Quota Management Areas 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9. Management measures that are likely to indirectly benefit this species include closure of most harbours and semi-enclosed bays in northern New Zealand to trawling and Danish seining, and a permanent ban on gill netting out to five nautical miles from shore off the northwest North Island (Fisheries statistical areas 41 and 42) to protect endangered North Island Hector's dolphin.",Unknown,NA,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

Fisheries across its range have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due  to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in  traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).  Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal  fishing effort and power in some parts of its range leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (Mohamed and Veena  2016).&#160;The Whitecheek Shark is taken in a variety of gear  including&#160;gillnet, longline, and bottom trawl fisheries.  The high level of exploitation in its habitat is of concern. For example, in India,  there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with  many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI  2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the  Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).  This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all  Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating. In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters,  targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M.  Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing  effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601  in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place.&#160;Many  countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks  (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other  fisheries.&#160;Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran (from  March to August) and the UAE (February to June). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman  have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993, and 2011,  respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have  seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species.&#160;However,&#160;incidental  catches occur in other fisheries (e.g.&#160;gillnetting) to which they are  more susceptible.<br/><br/>Research is needed to determine distribution,  population size, and trends in abundance to further assess status and any  future conservation needs.<br/><br/>Effective monitoring of fisheries is  required, as is the effective implementation and management of marine  protected areas. An education program on sustainable fishing and bycatch  mitigation is needed for fishers.",Decreasing,"To date, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for  this species.&#160;A Danish survey in 1937-38 recorded the Whitecheek Shark  as by far the most common species of shark in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (mostly Iranian  coast) (Blegvad and Løppenthin 1944), and it was also reported as common around Bahrain  in surveys carried out in 1974-78 (Herdson 1981). This species is  commonly caught in Iran where it is considered the most abundant species  (FAO 2009).&#160;Overall, it makes up about 60% of shark landings by number  in Iran (Arabian/Persian Gulf&#160;and Sea of Oman) and continues to be an important part of the  catch (T. Valinassab unpubl. data).&#160;This species also represented 22%  (in 2008) and 20% (in 2011) of elasmobranch landings by number in Kuwait, and 26% of elasmobranch landings by number in Qatar (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).  In Bahrain, it represented almost 3% of elasmobranchs landed by number  (Moore and Peirce 2013). In the UAE, it makes up 4.5% of shark landings  by number (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2016) and &lt;1% of sharks traded from Oman to the UAE (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015).  Henderson and Reeve (2014) only report nine specimens of this species  landed from data collected over five years of landing site surveys along  the coast of Oman. In Pakistan, it was among the most common species  caught in gillnet fisheries in the 1980s but is currently uncommonly  encountered (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).&#160;In India, Raje<em> et al.</em>  (2002) reported Whitecheek Shark as one of the major species contributing  to Indian fisheries. In 2003-2004, 58 t were recorded from gillnet  fisheries along the southwest coast (Raje <em>et al. </em>2007).  However, the Whitecheek Shark was not observed in surveys of landings in  Porbandar (Gujarat), Sasoon Dock (Mumbai) and Malvan (Maharashtra)  undertaken in 2014-2015 (D. Sutaria pers. comm. to R.W. Jabado  06/02/2017). This species was also reported as one of the dominant species landed by various fishing gears along the coast of Tamil Nadu (southeast coast of India in the 1980s and 1990s; Raje<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2002)). However, more recent landing site surveys (2002-2006) along the eastern Indian coast (Chennai) failed to record it (Mohanraj <em>et al.</em> 2009). A decline in abundance of over 50-70% based on catch levels  has occurred in India (S. J. Kizhakudan pers. comm. to Akhilesh K.K.  06/02/2017). Similarly, this species has not been reported from over a year of landing site surveys along the coast of Sri Lanka (D. Fernando pers. comm. to R.W. Jabado 02/08/2018).<br/><br/>Fisheries across its range have experienced increased  demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a  result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many  areas (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).  Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in  the Arabian/Persian Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly  carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).  Historical surveys in the&#160;Arabian/Persian Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks  comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980-81, whereas in  2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Shark  catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000  mt to 9,000 mt and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite  increasing efforts (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India  indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already  collapsed&#160;(Mohamed and Veena 2016). While there is limited  species-specific information available on this species, it  is marketed for consumption across its range, and the presence of  intensive fisheries mean that like many other carcharhinids in the  region it has declined.<br/><br/>The abundance of this species appears to have  followed two different trends. In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, it remains an abundant  species dominating landings of many countries, however, in the Arabian  Sea greater fishing intensity has resulted in suspected declines of at  least 50-70% in some areas. With  increasing fishing pressure across the Arabian Seas region, it is  suspected that this species has declined by at least 50-70% over the  past three generations (~12 years) and that  these declines are likely to be ongoing.&#160;A further population reduction  is suspected over&#160;the next three generations (2018-2030) based on current  levels of exploitation.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

The Silky Shark is both targeted or caught as incidental (bycatch) by longline fisheries and purse seine fisheries (especially those using drifting fish aggregating devices [FADs]) as well as by artisanal fisheries. FADs are made of a floating object and nets that lie vertical in the water column to attract schools of fish. The Silky Shark, as well as other species, is easily entangled in the nets; and there have been large increases in the use of FADs since 1996 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). Whether they are targeted or an incidental catch, the Silky Shark is often either retained for its meat and fins where regulations allow, or released with high mortality rates apparent in the tropical purse seine fisheries (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Total catches of the Silky Shark reported to FAO are mainly from Sri Lanka (Western Indian Ocean) with the FAO catch less than 4,000 tonnes (t) from 2005-2009 before doubling in 2010 and 2011. Catches then decreased to ~5,000 t in 2012 and 2013 (FAO 2015).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark was found to represent at least 3-4% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading centre—the third highest after Blue Shark and Hammerhead Shark (general) (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006a)—and Hong Kong is thought to make up more than half of the global shark fin trade (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006b). Silky Shark fins are valuable to the trade, although they are not one of the highest value fin types (S. Clarke, unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The Silky Shark is taken in pelagic commercial fisheries in the eastern central and southeast Pacific, as well as in coastal artisanal fisheries of the region. Fishing pressure from longline and purse seine fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is high, and it is the main shark species caught in fisheries using FADs as well as longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 2015). In addition to mortality, FADs may be influencing behaviour of the Silky Shark. In the eastern Pacific, Silky Shark diet contained high proportions of FAD-associated prey items, probably due to the increasing likelihood of an encounter with prey items at FADs (Duffy <em>et al</em>. 2015). If this behaviour continues, Silky Shark may be increasingly attracted to FADs and fishing mortality may be increased.<br/><br/>Mexico contributed the most to catch of the Silky Shark in the north and southeast Pacific, catching up to 40% of the total catch (12-16,000 t in the north and 11-16,000 t in the south per year) (IATTC 2013). The IATTC observer database from 1993-2005 showed that the Silky Shark was caught throughout the ocean west of central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru out to about 170°W on purse seines set on FADs. The Silky Shark was the most commonly caught species of shark in the purse seine fishery for tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean (IATTC 2007). The fishery has largely increased the use of FADs, which the Silky Shark is attracted to, increasing the catch rate of the Silky Shark in the fishery (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, it is mainly juveniles caught North of the equator and caught in FAD sets.<br/><br/>Reported catches of the Silky Shark are approximately four times higher north of the equator in the purse seine fleets (IATTC 2013). In the north, 30-45,000 individuals were caught each year (2006-2010), while in the south, &lt;10,000 individuals were caught each year (IATTC 2013). In the longline sector of the IATTC, annual catches of the Silky Shark ranged from 20-60,000 individuals in the north to 10-30,000 individuals in the south. Catches of the Silky Shark in waters around Mexico have been steadily increasing from the late 1970s, when over 3,000 t were caught to the 2000s, when 6-7,000 t of Silky Shark was caught (IATTC 2013). Central American unreported catch was estimated to be similar to the catch in Mexico of 6-7,000 sharks in recent years (IATTC 2013).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark are a major component of the shark catch in many fisheries along the Pacific coast of Central America. Observations made on a longline research vessel that sampled waters in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala found that Silky Shark constituted 31%, 47% and 29% of the total catch respectively, and 80%, 63% and 44% of the shark catch respectively (Porras 1996). Off Chiapas, southern Mexico, Silky Shark (along with Scalloped Hammerhead, <em>Sphyrna lewini</em>) form the large bulk of the shark catch (Soriano-Velásquez and Acal Sánchez 2008). In Tres Marías Islands, Mexico, Silky Shark is a major part of the catch constituting 27% of landed sharks in 1996 (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005). In San José and Buena Vista, Guatemala, Silky Shark constituted 73% of recorded catches landed, in a sample of 4,211 sharks, from 1996 to 1999 (Ruiz and Ixquiac 2000).<br/><br/>International longline vessels operating in the eastern central Pacific landed and exported over 8,000 t of shark carcasses and 900 t of shark fins from Costa Rica in 2002 (Costa Rica official INCOPESCA Fishery Statistics 2003), the large majority of which were recorded as the Silky Shark. However, these figures must be interpreted with caution as other sharks may have been misidentified as the Silky Shark. International vessels are known to transship shark products on the high seas, meaning these shipments are unreported. In 1991 in Costa Rica, sharks formed 27% of the total catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 2000, only 8% of the total catch was sharks, 71% of which were Silky Shark. In 2003, the proportion of sharks in the total catch decreased further to 5% of the total catch, the Silky Shark made up 58% of the shark catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Costa Rican longline fishery, most of the Silky Shark catch is composed of juveniles. Since 2004, adults made up less than 15% of the Silky Shark catch (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the total length of individuals caught decreased significantly from 2004 and 2007 to 2008-2010, indicating a decrease in spawning stock biomass (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Manta (the largest fishing port in Ecuador), artisanal fisheries data from September 2003 to the end of 2006 showed over 22,000 Silky Shark were caught (J. Martínez pers. comm. Feb. 2007). From 2008-2012, over 137, 000 individuals were caught throughout Ecuador which is six times the amount of the previous four years (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2015). The landed females ranged in length from 61-309 cm TL, and the males ranged in length from 63-288 cm TL. In terms of landed weight of the Silky Shark, in Ecuador in the early 2000s, less than 400 t were landed annually, and from 2007-2011, 900-1,300 t per year were landed (IATTC 2013). Catch records from 2007-2008 for nine ports in Ecuador show that catches of Silky Shark was highest in the warmer summer months from March-August (IATTC 2011). Individuals landed were mainly 114-246 cm TL for females and 101-233 cm TL for males with a peak at 160 cm TL for both sexes (IATTC 2011). This peak corresponds to immature individuals, therefore, a majority of the Silky Shark landed in Ecuador is immature.<br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The tropical waters of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) currently support the largest industrial tuna fishery in the world with an annual tuna catch approaching one million tonnes. The two main gear types, longline and purse seine, accounted for over 90% of the target tuna catch in this area in 1999 (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species found in the longline fishery are Silky Shark, Blue Shark, Pelagic Stingray (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>), and the Oceanic Whitetip (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>) (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species in the purse seine fishery is Silky Shark accounting for 95% of the elasmobranch bycatch in the FAD-associated purse seiners (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Due to the high rate of exploitation in the Indo-Pacific, the Silky Shark population is at risk of genetic diversity loss (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<br/><br/>In the WCPO, the longline fishery catches the highest number of Silky Shark with the estimated catch (based on observer data) in 2009 of 189,000 individuals compared to 69,790 individual Silky Shark taken in the same year for the purse seine fishery (Lawson 2011). Once brailed from purse seines, Silky Shark have been shown to be deceased 72% of the time when brought on board (Poisson <em>et al</em>. 2014). They have also been shown in the WCPO purse seine fishery to have a high post-release mortality of greater than 84% (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the WCPO, longlines and purse seines mainly catch juveniles (Rice and Harley 2013). In the western Pacific, a CPUE for Silky Shark of 1-25 kg per set was found on purse seine sets on tuna schools unassociated with FADs from 1998-2010 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). On purse seine sets on anchored FADs, the CPUE from 1998-2010 was between 5-50 kg per set and on drifting FADs, the CPUE was 25-60 kg per set (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In pelagic longlines based off Hawaii, Silky Shark is caught mainly on deep sea sets. Most of the Silky Shark catch (62.5%) was taken above the equator (0° to 10°N), even though only 3% of fishing was observed above the equator (Walsh and Clarke 2011).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, reported catches of Silky Shark increased by 1,058 t from 2003-2011 (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). This may be due to better reporting. Malaysia does not report catches but does list Silky Shark as a commercial species that is used for fins and meat. Silky Shark is sold locally in Malaysia and prices have been increasing (Lack and Sant 2012). Similarly, Vietnam has no data available on the amount of Silky Shark caught, but it is included in catch reports of sharks (Lack and Sant 2012). In Thailand, Silky Shark is noted as being caught at a “normal” amount, however, there is little training for fisheries officers in identification. This may account for an underestimation of Silky Shark catch (Krajangdara 2014).<br/><br/>Papua New Guinea had a coastal longline shark fishery in which Silky Shark made up &gt;50% of the shark catch (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the WCPFC requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark (see the <em>Conservation</em> section). Over 765 t of Silky Shark was caught in 2001. In 2011, 72% of sharks caught on longlines was Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). The proportion of Silky Shark in the shark longline catch was &gt;50% through 2013-mid 2014 (Jonathan Smart, pers. comms 2015). In the Solomon Islands, Silky Shark accounted for 23% of all longline bycatch and 84% of purse seine bycatch (in data collated in 2009; Lack and Meere 2009). The meat is kept for local subsistence and fins are exported. As of 2006, all fin exporters had to be licensed which increased the reliability of reported catches (McCoy 2006). In Fiji, Silky Shark accounted for 13% of longline bycatch and was caught in low levels in the purse seine fishery (2009 collated data; Lack and Meere 2009).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is a very common component of shark and tuna longline and tuna gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (Pacific and Indian Oceans) (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia’s reported shark catch represents 13% of the global total shark catch. Of this, 15% were reported as Silky Shark from 2001-2004. This represents an average annual catch of 15,943 t of Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). Since 2009, a National Plan of Action-Sharks (NPOA) in Indonesia has been implemented and Silky Shark is listed as a commercial species in the Indonesian NPOA (Lack and Sant 2012). Silky Shark is fished over its entire size range with larger individuals caught on longlines at the beginning of the season and smaller individuals caught in gillnets once the catch rate on longlines decreases (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is caught by Australian longline fisheries operating on both the east and west coasts, that is, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans respectively (Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2014). Due to management restrictions, total retained catch of sharks by these fisheries is low and Silky Shark is not a major of component of those that are retained. Overall effort on the west coast of Australia is low. Due to the spatial distribution of effort on the east coast (greatest between 25-30°S), few Silky Shark are captured. No assessment of Silky Shark has been undertaken by Australia (although the east coast fishery data was included in the WCPO Silky Shark stock assessment) (Rice and Harley 2013). Australia has a range of management measures in place to mitigate impacts on all sharks. These include trip limits of a maximum of 20 sharks, a ban on the use of wire traces and shark finning bans (Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese, and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). Sharks are targeted in several areas, including off India where they are captured using hook and line and in large mesh gillnets, which are among the world’s largest (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Silky Shark was the most commonly caught shark at FADs in the Indian Ocean during a small pilot study of observers onboard French vessels—61.5% of Silky Shark was discarded dead at sea, 30.5% partially alive kept onboard, ~7% discarded alive (Viera and Pianet 2006). In a more recent study of FADs in the Indian Ocean, it was estimated that 480,000-960,000 Silky Shark become entangled and subsequently die annually in Indian Ocean FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The number of Silky Shark that die by becoming entangled in the FADs was estimated as 5-10 times higher than the number estimated to be taken as bycatch in Indian Ocean FAD-associated purse seine sets (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sharks that were caught in FADs died and fell out within two days, therefore, there is the potential for very high levels of cryptic mortality on FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Indian Ocean, due to the high abundance of FADs, it was estimated a Silky Shark has a 29% chance of surviving to age 1, 9% chance of survival to 2 years, and only a 3% chance of survival to 3 years old (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Southwest coast of India, at Cochin, Silky Shark was recorded as a small portion of landed sharks through 2000-2002. In 2010, their contribution had increased to 16.3% of shark landings at Cochin (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, this increased contribution may partly be as a result of potential increase in reporting.<br/><br/>In the Maldives, it was estimated that some 85% of oceanic shark catch comprise Silky Shark (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). Although no specific data were available, Maldivian shark fishermen who specialize in longlining for oceanic sharks anecdotally reported declines in abundance and average size of Silky Shark; all fishers commented that Silky Shark numbers had decreased by &gt;50% in the past 20 years (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). A fishery for Silky Shark has operated off Sri Lanka for many years and Sri Lanka are one of the only countries to report species-specific Silky Shark catch to FAO. The Silky Shark reported landings have decreased in Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2011 by 2,798 t (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese fleet in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean longline fisheries is high and ongoing. In the United States, Silky Shark is caught by the commercial shark bottom longline and the pelagic longline fishery, and in recreational shark fisheries. In the shark bottom longline fishery in Gulf of Mexico and Southern Atlantic, Silky Shark represent a major by-product species (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Approximately 75% of individuals caught are retained, mainly comprising small individuals (&lt;110 cm TL). The rest are discarded, of which one third are discarded dead (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Silky Shark is one of the five most captured shark species caught in the Cuban longline fishery (Espinosa 2004).<br/><br/>Silky Shark is taken in several longline fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic, including those off Santos, southern Brazil (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Amorim <em>et al</em>. 1998), Natal, northeastern Brazil (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 1990) and Uruguay (Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is taken in artisanal gillnet fisheries off southern Paraná State (Costa and Chaves 2006). In Brazil, Silky Shark is generally retained and marketed (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). Silky Shark catch in the longline tuna fishery off Brazil increased from 2004-2008 and then declined from 2008-2010 (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). The highest catch rates occurred near the coast, with two exceptions in the central Atlantic. Similar to most catch data of Silky Shark, a high proportion of individuals were immature (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). In another part of the Atlantic, in Spain, the landings of Silky Shark plummeted in the early 2000s from 17 t in 2002 to ~1 t in 2011 (Eurostat 2013).","Silky Shark is a member of the family Carcharhinidae, which is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They were listed on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under Appendix II in 2014. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by 38 countries in 2010 for migratory sharks, and Silky Shark was added to the MOU in February 2016.<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is likely protected in the EEZs of countries that have banned all targeting of sharks in commercial fisheries operating in their waters. These countries include Palau, Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, the Marshall Islands, and the British Virgin Islands (Pew 2014). The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia, New Zealand), regional entities (EU) and all regional fisheries management organisations (e.g. ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) may discourage the capture of oceanic sharks for their fins, because most finning bans require that if fins are to be retained, they must remain attached to the carcass until landed.<br/><br/>Silky Shark retention bans are in place for all vessels operating under ICCAT and WCPFC management (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). Additionally, any Silky Shark that is brought on board must be released in the best condition possible and as quickly as possible. All interactions are recorded and the status upon release is recorded (alive or dead) (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). ICCAT has exemptions for developing countries that report the catch of Silky Shark, that have no increase in catch of Silky Shark and ensure that Silky Shark will not enter international trade (ICCAT 2011). The implementation of no retention policies for Silky Shark has likely allowed additional Silky Shark to be released, however Silky Shark have a high level of post-release mortality (&gt;84% in tropical tuna purse seines) and high level of hooking mortality (~56% on tropical longlines) (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015, Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2012). Post-release survival of Silky Shark was markedly improved in the US pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico when circle hooks became mandatory after August 2004. Survival increased from 41% in 1992-2004 to 56% in 2004-2010 (Serafy <em>et al</em>. 2012). IATTC has prohibited retention of Silky Sharks on purse seine vessels, limited longline vessel Silky Shark bycatch to a maximum of 20% by weight of total catch per fishing trip, and in multi-species fisheries that use surface longlines limited the catch of Silky Sharks that are less than 100 cm total length to 20% of the total number of Silky Sharks caught per trip (IATTC 2016). No management arrangements are in place for Silky Shark in the IOTC area (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Management of Silky Shark should focus on preventing capture and include small scale measures such as temporal and spatial closures as well as large scale regulations (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Eastern Pacific, significantly more juveniles are taken above the equator, and Watson (et al. 2009) concluded that larger closures above the equator would reduce the bycatch of Silky Shark of up to 33% while having &lt;10% effect on tuna catch. Smaller closures would have smaller effects on both Silky Shark catch and tuna catch, however, would still reduce juvenile fishing mortality (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Management of Silky Shark is made difficult by the limited knowledge of stock structure and migration patterns.<a name=""""_Hlk492292829""""></a>",Decreasing,"The Silky Shark population structure is poorly understood. Genetic studies found that in the Pacific, there are potentially three stocks; one stock in the western Pacific and two stocks in the eastern Pacific (north and south) separated by the equator (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, the degree of genetic separation is slight and may not be sufficient to consider them separate subpopulations. Population changes have been noted in all ocean regions but no population estimates are available.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Recent attempts have been made to assess the stocks from the eastern Pacific, although only indicators of population change could be used to infer changes in population due to major uncertainties in catch data from the early years of the time series (1994-1998) that hindered calculation of stock status (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). For the north eastern Pacific stock, standardised catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) estimates from the purse seine fishery on floating objects indicated an overall decline from 1994-2015 that included some periods of stability, a sharp decrease from 2010-2012 followed by a sharp increase from 2012-2015 (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). The cause of the changes from 2010 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2015 are unknown and may be partly due to changes in catchability, rather than abundance, because of environmental effects such as the El Niño events in 2010 and 2015 and La Niña events in 2011-2012 (Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). Additionally, in 1994 the spatial distribution of the purse seine fishery was much narrower compared to subsequent years (Aires da Silva 2014). Inclusion or exclusion of this first year of data makes a large difference to the estimate of CPUE decline over time. From 1994-2015 there was a decline of 32% (based on estimates from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). To estimate this decline over three generations (45 years), the CPUE data was extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. If 1994 is included, the estimated three generation decline is 60%; if 1994 is excluded, the estimated three generation decline is 17%.<br/><br/>For the southeast Pacific stock there was a sharp decline in standardised CPUE during 1994-2004 followed by stability up to 2013, an increase from 2013-2014 and little change in 2015 (Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). The estimate of decline in CPUE over the period 1994-2015 was 60% (based on Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). Inclusion or exclusion of the 1994 does not make a difference to the estimate of three generation decline which is 99% (based on CPUE data extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error.<br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean<br/></strong>A stock assessment for the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) estimated that the 2009 fishing mortality of Silky Shark exceeded the fishing mortality producing maximum sustainable yield by over four times (Rice and Harley 2013). This level of fishing mortality is estimated to have depleted the total stock biomass by 70% from the theoretical virgin stock biomass and is indicative that overfishing has occurred (Rice and Harley 2013). Estimated spawning biomass declined by 33% from 1995-2009 (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimates of biomass declines are derived from the stock assessment model based on the standardised CPUE series which is mostly determined from WCPO observer data that has limitations of low spatial and patchy temporal coverage (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimated spawning biomass decline from the stock assessment was used to estimate a three generation change by extraction of the data from Figure 13, Rice and Harley 2013 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population decline of 86% over three generations was estimated. A more recent assessment of Silky Shark standardised CPUE in the WCPO extended the data series by five years from 1995 to 2014 and reported high inter-annual variability with an initial decline from 1995-2000 followed by a slight increase until 2010, followed by a steep decline (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015). As the CPUE trend is different to that used in the stock assessment in Rice and Harley 2013, the more recent CPUE data was also used to estimate a three-generation change. The CPUE data was extracted from Figure 37, Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population increase of 18% over three generations was estimated. The differences in CPUE data used in Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015 generated very different three-generation change outcomes, with the latter study emphasising the need for an updated stock assessment. At this stage, the three-generation change is taken as the mid-point of the two studies, that is a 34% decline, although this should be revisited when an updated stock assessment becomes available.<br/><br/>In Hawaii, the Silky Shark nominal CPUE had remained stable through 2000 to 2010, indicating a possible stable population in that region (Walsh and Clarke 2011). The Hawaii data represents approximately one third of WCPO Observer data but was not included in the 2015 standardised CPUE estimates as it was only available up to 2011 (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015). A study from the tropical Central Pacific comparing 1950s and 1990s longline data estimated that the Silky Shark population had declined in abundance by 92% (Ward and Myers 2005). The reduction was likely attributed to the effects of fishing, although without a time-series index it was not possible to discount contributions of variations in oceanographic conditions and biases due to the different areas and gear sampled (Ward and Myers 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>In the Indian Ocean, there is no stock assessment or any reliable fishery indicators of status, therefore the stock status is highly uncertain (IOTC 2013, Lack <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>There is no stock assessment of the Silky Shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Analyses of longline research surveys and observer data from the Gulf of Mexico estimated that the abundance of the Silky Shark population had declined by 91% from 1950-1990 (Baum and Myers 2004). United States pelagic longline observer and logbook data (1992-2005) that encompasses both the northwest and western central Atlantic regions was used to estimate a decrease of 46 and 50% respectively in Silky Shark standardised CPUE (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007). The observer and logbook standardised CPUE data was extracted from Figures 6B and 6A respectively; Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. Population reductions of 95% and 98% respectively were estimated over three generations. However, Cortes <em>et al</em>. (2007) also reported that relative abundance of Silky Shark appeared to be increasing in the area since 2000 and advised caution in interpreting the catch trends due to short-comings in the data and the highly migratory nature of the Silky Shark that requires a more comprehensive analysis of trends throughout their range. Another analyses of the observer data from this same fishery over 1992-2005 combined catches of Dusky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em>), Silky Shark, and Night Shark (<em>Carcharhinus signatus</em>), grouped because of identification problems, and reported that the standardized catch rates of this species complex were suspected to have declined by 76% (Baum and Blanchard 2010).<br/><br/>To estimate a global population trend, the three generation population trends estimated from standardized CPUE data for each region (and the spawning biomass from the WCPO) were weighted according to the relative size of each region’s surveyed area. This assumed that Silky Shark is evenly distributed throughout its surveyed range. For the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, the estimated declines in the north (60% and 17%; with and without 1994 data respectively) and the 99% decline for the south were used (based on Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 data); for the Western Central Pacific Ocean, a 34% decline was used (based on Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015); and in the Atlantic Ocean, as the three generation decline estimates from Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007 data were so similar, the average of the two estimated declines was used, that is, 97%. The estimated weighted global population trend is a 47-54% decline over the equivalent of three generation spans. This is a best estimate based on the most reliable data currently available from each region. There are areas that have no reliable catch data, such as the Indian Ocean, which should be included in the future as data become available.<br/><p></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

The major threat comes from long-lining and other bait-fishing activities around islands and sub-sea mounts throughout its range. The aggressive nature of this common species together with the occupation of inshore habitats may result in pressures to extirpate local populations. Evidence of such reductions/extirpations exists for this species around Central America (Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) (L.J.V. Compagno, pers. comm.). The interrupted geographical distribution and unknown level of immigration to these isolated populations could place subpopulations at significant risk from over fishing. It should also be noted that uncontrolled legal and illegal shark fin fishing takes place at sites in the Pacific, including the Galápagos Marine Resources Reserve where a significant population of this species is known to occur (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> in press)","The Data Deficient listing for Australia and Oceania waters reflects the lack of information about this species in this region where it is the species is known from only a very few sites, and the number of individuals, their movements on a daily and seasonal basis and the levels of immigration/emigration are unknown.

Bull sharks more frequently encounter humans while in waters of low salinity, and are thereby subjected to increased fishing pressure and environmental changes associated with habitat modification.<br/><br/>Bull Sharks are commonly caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries. Thorson (1982a) reported that a commercial fishery existed for <em>C. leucas</em> in Lake Nicaragua and the Rio San Juan river system in Central America. However, in most situations, Bull Sharks are not normally a fishery target species but are caught as bycatch or as part of a multi-species fishery. For example, in the US Atlantic region they are an important component of inshore ecosystems, but only comprise 1-6% of the large coastal shark catch for this area (Branstetter and Burgess 1997). <br/><br/>While the Bull Shark has been exploited commercially for its skin, liver oil and flesh, currently its fins are the major product driving demand for this and many other species. There are limited data on recreational catches of this species. The best data come from the Gulf of Mexico where Casey and Hoey (1985) reported that in 1978 <em>C. leucas</em> made up about 11% (by weight) of the recreational shark catch of around three million pounds (Casey and Hoey 1985). Recreational catches of large sharks in the Gulf of Mexico have decreased substantially since the 1970s, but Casey and Hoey's results illustrate that recreational fishing may have a substantial impact on Bull Shark populations.<br/><br/>Beach protection programmes in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and Queensland, Australia also regularly catch Bull Sharks. Cliff and Dudley (1992) reported that between 1978 and 1990 the South African programme caught 59 Bull Sharks, 21% of which were released alive. Species identification problems occurred in the Queensland programme until the early 1990s, thus the importance of <em>C. leucas</em> can only be based on data from latter years. Gribble <em>et al.</em> (1998) reported that after identification was improved 16% of the sharks caught state-wide were Bull Sharks, with the majority caught in the central part of the state. The lack of historical data for the Queensland programme and the low abundance in the South African programme make it impossible to assess the impact of beach meshing on Bull Shark populations.<br/><br/>The location of nursery areas in estuarine and freshwater systems makes the species vulnerable to pollution and habitat modification, but there has been only limited study of these impacts on Bull Sharks. Canal developments have been prolific in some estuarine areas where the species is commonly found. It is not known whether these developments have negative impacts. In Florida, USA and the Gold Coast of Queensland, Australia, these developments have substantially altered the environment. Bull Sharks occur frequently in Gold Coast canals and the species has been responsible for a number of attacks on humans (Simpfendorfer unpubl.). The warm water effluent from power stations may also impact this shark. In Florida, USA, juveniles have been reported to be trapped in the warm water outfalls during winter when they would normally have migrated to warmer water areas (Snelson <em>et al. </em>1984, <em>C. Manire</em>, Center for Shark Research, Mote Marine Laboratory pers. Comm.). The potential impacts of pollution and habitat modification need to be further investigated for this species.<br/><br/>This shark is also exploited by large aquariums. The species is good for public display, adapting well to life in a tank and providing a good example of a larger, aggressive shark. With the number of public aquaria rising worldwide there is an increasing demand for this and other species of sharks for display. While populations are healthy the needs of aquaria can probably be met without affecting the wild population. However, if a wild subpopulation is depleted this may not be the case and aquaria need to have responsible collection policies that will not result in further pressure being placed on a species. At present there is no evidence that collecting for aquariums has any impact on the wild population of Bull Shark.","No specific management or conservation programmes are known for this species.

This species was initially described as the most common pelagic shark beyond the continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico (Wathne 1959, Bullis 1961), and throughout the warm-temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic and Pacific (Mather and Day 1954, Strasburg 1957). In the Gulf of Mexico, for example, between 2 and 25 of these sharks were usually observed following the vessel during longline retrieval on the exploratory surveys in the 1950s and their abundance was considered as a serious problem because of the high proportion of tunas they damaged (Bullis and Captiva 1955, Backus <em>et al</em>. 1956, Wathne 1959). Recent shark papers on the Gulf of Mexico have either not mentioned this species or have dismissed it as rare, not recognising its former prevalence in the area (Baum and Myers 2004). <br/> <br/>Few data are available on the catch rate of these sharks, and this is a serious hindrance to assessing the status of this species in regions other than the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Central Pacific. Strasburg (1958) reported that the oceanic whitetip shark constituted 28% of the total shark catch in exploratory tuna longline fishing south of 100 N latitude in the central Pacific Ocean. According to Berkeley and Campos (1988), oceanic whitetip sharks constituted 2.1% of the shark bycatch in the swordfish fishery along the east coast of Florida in 1981 to 1983. Taniuchi (1990) analysed Japanese fishery statistics and noted that this species was most commonly taken by fishery boats in the Pacific, where they made up 20 to 30% of the number of sharks taken by tuna longliners, compared to about 3 to 4% in the Indian Ocean, because the boats are fishing for southern bluefin tuna in cooler waters. Guitart Manday (1975) demonstrated a marked decline in the oceanic whitetip shark landings in Cuba from 1971 to 1973. In the Maldives, Anderson and Ahmed (1993) reported that oceanic whitetip sharks were taken commercially by pelagic shark longliners and incidentally by tuna fishermen, and that in a previous exploratory fishing survey oceanic whitetip sharks constituted 23% of all sharks caught.  <br/> <br/>Domingo (2004) reported that the Uruguayan longline fleet observer programme in 1998 to 2003 recorded catch rates of only 0.006 sharks/1,000 hooks in Uruguayan and adjacent high seas South Atlantic waters (latitude 26° to 37°, 16 to 23°C) and 0.09 sharks/1,000 hooks in international waters off the Atlantic coast of Africa. He notes that similarly infrequent records are obtained by Brazilian and Ecuadorian Atlantic longline fleets.","Conservation and management action are urgently required for this species; the only known conservation measure at present is a broad, multi-species pelagic shark quota for U.S. Atlantic waters. Specifically, fishing pressure on this species must be considerably decreased through reduction in fishing effort, catch limits, measures to enhance chances of survival after capture and possibly also through the implementation of large-scale oceanic non-fishing areas. Effective conservation of this species will require international cooperation. The oceanic whitetip is listed as a highly migratory species under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA). The Agreement specifically requires coastal States and fishing States to cooperate and adopt measures to ensure the conservation of these listed species. To date, there is little progress in this regard. See <a href=""""http://www.unclos.com"""">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> for further details. Also of relevance is the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks) which specifically recommends that Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFO) carry out regular shark population assessments and that member States cooperate on joint and regional shark management plans. This is of particular importance for pelagic sharks such as <em>C. longimanus</em> whose stocks are exploited by more than one State on the high seas. Although steps are being taken by some RFOs to collect species-specific data on pelagic sharks, and to ban the practise of shark finning, to date no RFO has limited shark catches or drafted a """"Shark Plan"""" as suggested in the IPOA-Shark guidelines (R. Cavanagh, pers. comm).",Decreasing,"This species, together with the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falciformis</em> and blue shark <em>Prionace glauca</em>, has often been described as one of the three most abundant species of oceanic sharks and large marine animals (Compagno 1984, Taniuchi 1990, Bonfil 1994, Castro <em>et al</em>. 1999). Recent observations, however, indicate that this species that was formerly """"nearly ubiquitous in water deeper than 180 m and above 20°C"""" (Castro <em>et al</em>. 1999) is now only occasionally recorded (e.g., Baum and Myers 2004, Domingo 2004).  <br/> <br/>The population dynamics and structure of this species are unknown. Distribution appears to depend on size and sex and the nursery areas appear to be oceanic (Seki <em>et al</em>. 1998). Larger individuals are caught deeper than smaller ones and there is geographic and sexual segregation (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Longline catches in the Central Pacific show that this species definitely increases in abundance as a function of increasing distance from land, and, unlike the silky shark <em>Carcharhinus falcifomis</em>, it does not congregate around land masses (Compagno in prep.).  <br/> <br/>In the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic enormous declines are estimated to have occurred. Two estimates of trends in abundance from standardized catch rate indices have been made from independent datasets. An analysis of the US pelagic longline logbook data between 1992 and 2000, which covers the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic regions, estimated declines of 70% (Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003). An analysis of the Gulf of Mexico, which used data from US pelagic longline surveys in the mid-1950s and US pelagic longline observer data in the late-1990s, estimated a decline of 99.3% over this forty year time period (Baum and Myers 2004). When trends in abundance from the former analysis are extrapolated back to the mid-1950s, they match the latter analysis almost exactly (99.8%). Over a period of three generations (30 years), the estimated decline is 98%. However, the latter study has recently been criticized because temporal changes in fishing gear and practices over the time period were not taken fully into account and the study may, therefore, have exaggerated or underestimated the magnitude of the declines (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2005, Baum <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

The species has among the most sought after fins for shark fin soup because of their large size and high fin needle content (ceratotrichia) (TRAFFIC 1996, R. Hudson pers. comm.). Because of its high-value fin, dusky sharks caught incidentally in tuna and swordfish fisheries are now regularly landed rather than released. <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Carcharhinus obscurus</span> was found to represent at least 1.2-1.7% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading center (Clarke <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2006a). It is estimated that between 144,000 and 767,000 Dusky Sharks are represented in the shark fin trade each year or, in biomass, 6,000 to 30,000 mt (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The very low intrinsic rate of increase of the Dusky Shark renders this species among the most vulnerable of all vertebrates (including great whales and sea turtles) to man-induced mortality (Compagno <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005, Musick 1999). Furthermore, Compagno <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. (2005) report that the species is difficult to manage or protect because it is taken in mixed species fisheries, and has a high mortality rate when taken as bycatch.<br/><br/>Further threats to <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> are from beach meshing programs in Australia and South Africa and from recreational fishing. Beach meshing in Australia (Queensland and News South Wales) undoubtedly catches <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span>, however, species-specific data are not available. Between 1972 and 1990, the New South Wales programme caught a total of 765 whaler sharks (Reid and Krough 1992), of which Stevens (1984) reported the capture of larger juvenile and adult <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> by recreational fishers off the east coast of Australia. Dusky sharks were one of the most important species in the trophy shark tournaments held in Florida, USA, until the stock collapsed (Heuter 1994).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Northwest and Western Central Atlantic</span><br/>The initial decline of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic was caused by a targeted recreational fishery that developed in the late-1970s and by bycatch in the pelagic swordfish longline fishery (Musick <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1993). A rapid expansion of the directed commercial shark fishery in the US in the late 1980s was fuelled in large part by the demand for shark fins in the markets of Asia (Cook 1990). Although Dusky Shark meat is used domestically in the US, the very high value of the fins suggests that the decline in this dusky shark population over past decades has been, and continues to be, driven by international trade in shark fins. There is little reason to believe that the demand for dusky shark products will lessen, especially as other fishery resources become increasingly depleted. In the Gulf of Mexico during the late 1980s, the dusky shark was the fourth most abundant species in the tuna longline bycatch, where medium to large dusky sharks were often shot, finned and discarded (Russell 1993).<br/><br/>Declining catch rates for Dusky Sharks in this area have been a cause for concern. Off North America the proportion of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> in the catch decreased, while fishing for more abundant species continued (Musick <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1993). <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Carcharhinus obscurus</span> was put on the protected list in 2000, requiring all individuals captured in the longline fishery to be released. Even though the mortality of small juveniles on the longline was as high as 50% (lower for larger juveniles and adults) (Romine 2004), the juveniles have shown an increase of about 30% from the lowest point in the time series to 2005 in the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) survey, and continue to rise. This increase was not apparent in the stock assessment, which analysed catch data and multiple fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent time series data sets in the western Atlantic (NMFS 2006). This assessment led to estimated declines of 62-92% between 1974 and 2003. These declines are of the same magnitude as those found in analyses of the VIMS survey data (Musick <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1993, Romine 2004, Ha 2006), but in these studies the low point in Dusky Shark abundance occurred in the early-1990s. The NMFS (2006) assessment, which did not include the 2004-2006 VIMS survey data (which shows a further increase in juveniles) may not have detected the recent increase of juveniles because it was heavily influenced by pelagic data sets collected in deep water where juveniles are absent. The other long-term shark targeted survey in this region, which has been conducted off Cape Lookout, North Carolina through the University of North Carolina annually between 1972 and 2005 (data available to 2003) has captured 1,036 Dusky Sharks. This survey series shows a large, statistically significant decline of 98.8% (95%CI: 97.5-99.6%) and found evidence of no increase in recent years (Myers <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. in prep.).<br/><br/>A new analysis of observer data from the U.S. Atlantic pelagic longline fishery from 1992-2005 (which combined catches of Dusky, Silky, and Night Sharks because of identification problems) suggests that this species complex has declined significantly, by 70% (95% CI: 54-81%) during this recent time period (Baum <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. in prep.). The observer data shows a steeper decline when Dusky Shark is analysed alone, but this analysis ignores species identification problems, and hence is not considered reliable (Baum <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. in prep.). For the Gulf of Mexico, an analysis of data from U.S. pelagic longline research surveys conducted in the mid-1950s and U.S. pelagic longline observer data from the late-1990s estimated that dusky sharks declined by 79% over this forty-year period (Baum and Myers 2004), which is less than the three generation period for this species. Thus, recent management actions in the US may have led to an increase in the numbers of juvenile Dusky Sharks, however adults still appear to be declining.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Southwest Atlantic</span><br/>This species is taken both incidentally and as a target species in longline and artisanal fisheries throughout Brazilian waters and elsewhere in the South Atlantic. It is taken by longline off Santos where it is retained as """"other sharks"""" (Arfelli and Amorim 1994). The species has also been recorded from artisanal fisheries off Rio de Janeiro State (Sant'Anna and Siqueira 2000) and from southern Sao Paulo State (Motta <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1997, Bertozzi <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2000, Gadig <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2000). From July 1996 to February 1997 the species made up 1.12% of the catch (Motta <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1997) and 5.61% of the total catch from 1996 to 1999, which consisted mostly of juveniles, most frequently caught in June and August (Gadig <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2000). A number of countries operate longline fleets targeting tuna and swordfish in the high seas areas of the Southwest Atlantic region. In addition to the coastal nations of the Southwest Atlantic, nations including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Spain, Bolivia, Cape Verde, United Kingdom, China and Barbados also operate vessels here. Tuna and swordfish longline fisheries now also target sharks due to increasing demand for shark products and the value of their fins (Bonfil <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005, Mejuto <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Mediterranean Sea</span><br/>The main threats in the Mediterranean Sea are commercial fisheries. This species is caught sporadically in longline, setline, gillnet and sometimes by tuna trap (""""Tonnara - Tonnarella"""") fisheries, principally off North African and rather less frequently by surface longlines, artisanal setlines and possibly trawlers in the Sicilian Channel. Carcharhinid sharks have been caught as target or bycatch in historical fisheries in this region, where fishing pressure is high, however there are few species-specific records from which to elucidate population trends. <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Carcharhinus obscurus</span> is rarely observed on fishmarkets in the Mediterranean, but is easily mistaken for other """"grey"""" requiem shark carcasses, such as <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. plumbeus</span>. This species is utilised for human consumption in several areas of the Mediterranean, including Sicily, Malta and Libya, although the meat is considered of low commercial value.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Australia</span><br/>The fishery for <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> off southwestern Australia developed in the 1940s, but rapidly increased in the late 1970s to produce annual catches of 500-600 t. The fishery uses demersal gillnets (16.5 to 17.8 cm stretched mesh) to target neonates in the nursery area and the selectivity of the nets results in very few individuals over three years of age being captured. The flesh of the young <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> is highly regarded and fetches a good price on local markets. Fins are also sold. Current estimates are that 18-28% of neonates are caught in their first year. An assessment using demographic models indicated that the fishery was sustainable at the then level of catch provided the fishing mortality of animals larger than two metres was less than 4% (Simpfendorfer 1999). However, a more recent assessment (McAuley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005) found that the stock was less productive than previously thought, and that mortality of older dusky sharks in wetline fisheries outside the target fisheries was leading to a decline in recruitment. This assessment also estimated that the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Dusky Sharks declined by more than 75% between the early 1970s and 2004, and that the decline was continuing. In 2006 additional management measures were introduced to the fishery (see below), including a maximum size limit for Dusky Shark. These management measures should arrest further declines, but continued monitoring and assessment will be essential to monitor the stock, and the effectiveness of these measures.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">South Africa</span><br/>Off South Africa, there is a pelagic tuna longline fishery that may take some as bycatch but this is unconfirmed. There is a small commercial line fishery taking juvenile <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span>, and there is a recreational line fishery that targets juvenile <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> but most are released (they were not released a decade ago) and there is the beach meshing operation that catches juveniles, adolescents and adults. <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Carcharhinus obscurus </span>would have been a significant component in the beach meshing program off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between 1978 and 1999, when the mean annual catch of was 256 individuals (range 129-571, Dudley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). There was no trend in either catch or catch rate. A subsequent update by Dudley and Simpfendorfer (2006) showed no trend in either catch rate or size over the period 1978-2003. The large mesh size of the nets used in these programs means that many of the <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> taken are sub-adults and adults, but juveniles are also caught. The occurrence of sub-adult and adult <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> off KwaZulu-Natal is affected by an annual winter influx of sardines Sardinops sagax and shark catches are influenced by attempts to remove the nets in advance of the arrival of the sardine shoals (Dudley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). Reports of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> in recreational fisheries are limited. Van der Elst (1979) reported that large numbers of juvenile <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">C. obscurus</span> were taken by recreational shore anglers in South Africa and Govender and Birnie (1997) have expressed concerns about the high rate of instantaneous fishing mortality in this fishery, although there is an increasing tendency to release the sharks.","Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is needed for this biologically vulnerable shark. It is also essential to improve data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Family Carcharhinidae is listed as highly migratory under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA). The Agreement specifically requires coastal and fishing States to cooperate and adopt measures to ensure the conservation of listed species. To date, there has been little progress (see <a href=""""http://www.unclos.com"""">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> for further details). Also of relevance is the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks) which recommends that Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) carry out regular shark population assessments and that member States cooperate on joint and regional shark management plans. This is of particular importance for species such as dusky shark whose stocks are exploited by many States on the high seas. Steps are being taken by some RFOs, such as ICCAT, to collect species-specific data on pelagic sharks. To date two RFOs, ICCAT and IATTC, have adopted finning bans, as have several range states (e.g., Canada, USA, EU, Australia, Brazil etc.). More are likely to follow suit.<br/><br/>Canada and the USA have shark management plans (NMFS 1993, Joyce 1999). In US Atlantic waters dusky sharks are a prohibited species (outside of the shark research fishery) on the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and sharks. Prohibited species must be released immediately with minimum injury and without removing them from the water. The population appears to be responding to this measures, with substantial recruitment over the last six years (Ha 2006, Musick unpublished, Romine 2004), but it remains to be seen how many of these recruits will survive to maturity given the high bycatch mortality.<br/><br/>Management of the Australian fishery is through input controls implemented as time-gear units. In 2006, the Western Australian Government introduced a number of changes in all commercial fisheries to reduce mortality, particularly of dusky and sandbar sharks, including: a maximum size limit for Dusky Shark; additional controls on the use of longline; and the conversion of monthly gear units to daily gear units (McLoughlin 2008, McAuley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). The main management objective is to achieve target biomass levels of 40% of the initial biomass by 2040 for Dusky Shark (McLoughlin 2008).",Decreasing,"This species is estimated to have undergone population decline in several areas of its range, as summarized in the threats section, below.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

This species is caught with longlines, hook-and-line, and set bottom nets and is  also fished with rod and reel by sports anglers as a game fish (Compagno in  prep.). Sandbar sharks were found to represent at least 2-3% of the fins  auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading center (Clarke  <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Their fins are generally considered to be of high value,  comparable to dusky shark and hammerhead fins (S. Clarke unpubl. Data). Tagging,  age and growth studies show that sandbar sharks are a long-lived species with  low fecundity and are very vulnerable to over-fishing (Springer 1960, Casey  <em>et al.</em> 1985, Sminkey and Musick 1995, 1996; McAuley <em>et al. </em>2005,  2006). It is an important component of shark fisheries in most areas where it  occurs and has been severely overfished in the Northwest and Western Central  Atlantic, Mediterranean, Southern Brazil and probably the Northeast Pacific. It  has declined from fishing off western Australia and is common but not fished in  Hawaiian waters (Romine <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Northwest Atlantic</span><br/>Along  the Atlantic coast of the US, Branstetter and Burgess (1995) reported that this  species contributed up to 60% of the catch and 80% of the landings in the  directed longline fishery. In addition, the sandbar shark is second only to the  blue shark <em>Prionace glauca</em> (a pelagic species) in the US Atlantic  recreational shark fishery (Hoff and Musick 1990). During the last 20 years the  recreational and commercial fisheries for sharks along the south Atlantic coast  of the US and in the Gulf of Mexico have expanded at rapid rates (Anderson 1985,  1990; Casey and Hoey 1985, Hoff and Musick 1990). Recreational catch has been  estimated at 2.5 million sharks (c.35,000 t) annually; 20-40% of these are killed  (National Marine Fisheries Service 1993). Driven by increased marketability, the  commercial fishery has rapidly expanded since 1985, with landings exceeding  7,100 t in 1989 (National Marine Fisheries Service 1993). In the Northwest and  Western Central Atlantic sandbar shark stocks were reduced by 85-90% in just 10  years because of over-exploitation. This species continued to support a  substantial fishery after such a severe population decline only because of the  very large size of the original stock. In addition, the age structure of the  population has been shifted dramatically toward younger age classes. Adult  females became very uncommon (Musick et al. 1993). Furthermore, the average size  of sandbar sharks off Virginia in 2005 had declined to 32% of the size in 1975  (Ha 2006). A Fishery Management Plan was introduced in 1993, on which <em>C.  plumbeus </em>is managed as a coastal species. Several states (Virginia, North  Carolina, Texas and Florida) also enacted laws to regulate shark fishing in  their respective regions (14% of commercial and 64% of recreational catches  occur in state controlled waters). Although biomass of the species was reported  to have increased by 2002 (Cortes <em>et al. </em>2002), a recent assessment  estimated that the stock is still only 35-47% of virgin biomass and 26-43% of  virgin mature abundance in numbers (SEDAR 2006). Further evidence of decline  comes from newly available analyses of survey data: A shark-targeted longline  research survey from the University of North Carolina, conducted annually  between 1972 and 2003 off Cape Lookout has caught 310 sandbar sharks. The  standardized CPUE time series for this survey indicates significant declines for  sandbar shark amounting to an 86% decline, with no recovery in the latter years  of the survey (Myers <em>et al. </em>in prep). A second shark-targeted longline  survey conducted in South Carolina in 1983-84 and 1993-1995 shows large  significant declines in sandbars, amounting to a 97% decline just over this 13  year time period (Myers <em>et al.</em> in prep). Finally, a trawl survey  conducted in Delaware Bay by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and  Environmental Control between 1964 and 2004 shows a significant decline rate,  that over this 41 year time period amounts to an 84% decline (Myers <em>et  al.</em> in prep). <br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Southwest Atlantic</span><br/>Intensive fishing by pair trawl,  gillnet and beach seine on pupping and nursery grounds is thought to have caused  excessively high juvenile mortality to the point of threatening the population  of the species in southern Brazil. Fishing with these gears has been intense in  this species' habitat during the last 20 years. The company SOPESCA in Rio  Grande recorded receipt of 10t of <em>C. plumbeus</em> on 11 February 1983. A  record of a typical beach seine catch on 23 February 1983 indicates that 20  individuals of <em>C. plumbeus</em> were caught within a single haul, with seven  specimens smaller than 80cm TL (Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005). No catches of the  species were observed during shore fishery monitoring in summer 2003, but  neonates of <em>C. plumbeus</em> were common during monitoring of a coastal  fishing at depths of 18-60m between Tramandaí and Saint Simão in summer 2005.  Neonates of <em>C. brevipinna, C. falciformis </em>and <em>C. signatus</em> were  also observed in this area, as well as adults of <em>Carcharias taurus</em>, which  is Critically Endangered in this region (Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005).  Carcharhinus plumbeus is also caught off Uruguay and northern Argentina (A.  Domingo pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Adults of this species are also caught by pelagic  fisheries operating off the Atlantic coast of South America. A number of  countries operate longline fleets targeting tuna and swordfish in the high seas  areas of the Southwest Atlantic region. In addition to the coastal nations of  the Southwest Atlantic, nations including Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Spain, Bolivia,  Cape Verde, United Kingdom, China and Barbados also operate vessels here.  However, with the exception of Taiwan, (and during certain periods of the year,  Korea and Spain), the effort of these fleets is minor compared with other areas  of the Atlantic (Bonfil 1994). This species is taken, along with other  Carcharhinids in these fisheries (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2005). Tuna and swordfish  longline fisheries now also target sharks due to increasing demand for shark  products and the value of their fins (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005, Mejuto <em>et  al. </em>2006). <br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Mediterranean Sea</span><br/><em>Carcharhinus plumbeus</em> is  caught with surface and bottom longlines, gillnets and occasionally trawls in  the Mediterranean Sea, including in the Sicilian Channel, off Tunisia, Libya and  Egypt, Spain, Morocco and Algeria and infrequently elsewhere. There are also  anecdotal reports of bycatch of this species in fixed tuna traps (Tonnara) in  Sicily. Both coastal and pelagic fishing pressure is high throughout much of the  Mediterranean Sea. <br/><br/>This species was common until the 1980s along all the  Levantine coasts (Saad <em>et al. </em>2004), where it was the most dominant  species in shark catches (&gt;85%) (Baranes and Ben Tuvia 1978). The sandbar  shark <em>C. plumbeus</em> is still the most important shark species captured in  this area, however, there has been a significant decline in captures (M. Bradai  pers. obs. 2008). <br/><br/>The Gulf of Gabès, Tunisia, and an area off Turkey  appear to be important nursery grounds for this species (Capapé 1984, Saidi  <em>et al.</em> 2005; Bradai <em>et al.</em> 2006, STECF 2003). There are no recent  records of gravid females of this species in the Mediterranean outside of these  areas. Constantini and Affronte (2003) report that the northern Adriatic Sea may  also be an important nursery area for the species, based on six neonatal sandbar  sharks captured with gillnets in this area between 1998 and 2000. The last  record of a pregnant female sandbar shark from this area was recorded in 1982  (Constantini and Affronte 2003, Travaglini 1982). <br/><br/>This species was  previously regularly seen on fish markets of southern Sicily during the summer  months but has not been observed on the same markets in recent years (F.  Cigala-Fulgosi and M. Vacchi pers. obs. 2003). A similar situation is apparent  in the eastern Adriatic sea (Lipej <em>et al. </em>2000, A. Soldo pers comm.) and  therefore recent publications have described <em>C. plumbeus </em>as an endangered  species in the Adriatic Sea (Lipej <em>et al.</em> 2004). However, in Tunisia, the  species is regularly landed and observed in fish markets (Bradai <em>et al.</em>  2006).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Gabès, juvenile <em>C. plumbeus</em> are caught with  longlines and trawls and adult females are targeted using specially-designed  gillnets (locally known as """"kallabia"""" from """"kalb' bhar"""" (literally sea dog)  which means shark in Arabic) during spring and early summer, when they move  inshore to pup (Saidi <em>et al. </em>2005, Bradai <em>et al.</em> 2006). Given the  high biological vulnerability of this species to exploitation, the declines  observed in other areas of its range where it is taken as a target and bycatch  and continuing, unregulated fishing pressure in this area, it is strongly  suspected that this stock will also decline. <br/><br/>The species is a known  bycatch of pelagic fisheries operating within Mediterranean waters (STECF 2003),  but recent records appear to be very rare. While, in the Gulf of Gabès, juvenile  <em>C. plumbeus</em> represent a major component in total capture of the pelagic  fisheries targeting swordfish (Bradai <em>et al. </em>2006). In a study of  incidental catch of pelagic sharks from the swordfish and tuna fisheries  operating throughout the Mediterranean Sea from 1998-2000, only two specimens of  <em>C. plumbeus</em> were recorded in one area (the Straits of Sicily)  (Megalofonou <em>et al. </em>2005). Although blue shark, shortfin mako and  thresher sharks make up the bulk of shark catch in the Moroccan pelagic driftnet  fisheries in the eastern Mediterranean, Carcharhinid species are also known to  be taken and landed by this fleet on an occasional basis. Some boats are known  to deploy their nets near to the coast (1-2 miles from the shore) to target  pelagic sharks (Tudela <em>et al. </em>2005). Important catches of Carcharhinids  such as <em>C. plumbeus</em> are also made in the pelagic longline fishery  operating from ports in eastern Algeria (Walker <em>et al.  </em>2005).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation of this species' coastal nursery areas  through coastal development and pollution also poses an important  threat.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Northwest and Western Central Pacific</span><br/>This species is a known  catch of longline, trawl and set net fisheries operating throughout large areas  of this region. It is a known catch of shark longline and tuna gillnet fisheries  operating off Indonesia (White <em>et al. </em>2006). Japanese data on sandbar  sharks are limited, but reported landings in Japan's coastal ports show a sharp  decline during the period since 1992. At that time landings totaled 126 mt per  annum, but this amount decreased to 91 mt in 1995, 21 mt in 2000 and 3 mt in  2004. No CPUE trends are available (Japan Fisheries Agency 2006). In Taiwan,  Province of China, catches and sizes have decreased during recent years,  particularly in north east waters (Chen <em>et al.  </em>1996).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Australia</span><br/>Sandbar sharks are an important component of the  Western Australian shark fishery. Current total biomass is probably at about 35%  of its level prior to the start of full-time northern shark fishing. Current  management arrangements in the fishery should arrest any further declines in  stock biomass, but continued monitoring and assessment will be essential to  monitor the stock, and the effectiveness of these measures. See McAuley <em>et  al.</em> (2005) for a summary of the fishery and stock status.","Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries  is needed for this biologically vulnerable shark. It is also essential to  improve data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Family  Carcharhinidae is listed as highly migratory under the 1995 UN Agreement on the  Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish  Stocks (UNFSA). The Agreement specifically requires coastal and fishing States  to cooperate and adopt measures to ensure the conservation of listed species. To  date, there has been little progress (see <a href=""""http://www.unclos.com"""">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> for further  details). Also of relevance is the FAO International Plan of Action for the  Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks) which recommends that  Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) carry out regular shark population  assessments and that member States cooperate on joint and regional shark  management plans. This is of particular importance for species such as sandbar  shark whose stocks are exploited by many States on the high seas. Steps are  being taken by some RFOs, such as ICCAT, to collect species-specific data on  pelagic sharks. To date two RFOs, ICCAT and IATTC, have adopted finning bans, as  have several range states (e.g. Canada, USA, EU, Australia, Brazil etc.). More  are likely to follow suit.<br/><br/>Canada and the USA have shark management plans  (NMFS 1993, Joyce 1999). In US Atlantic waters Sandbar Sharks are a prohibited  species (outside of the shark research fishery) on the Fishery Management Plan  for Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and sharks. Prohibited species must be released  immediately with minimum injury and without removing them from the  water.<br/><br/>The species is under a comprehensive management plan in Western  Australia (McAuley <em>et al.</em> 2005). Management of the Australian fishery is  through input controls implemented as time-gear units. In 2006, the Western  Australian Government introduced a number of changes in all commercial fisheries  to reduce mortality, particularly dusky and sandbar shark, including: a maximum  size limit for dusky shark; additional controls on the use of longline; and the  conversion of monthly gear units to daily gear units (McLoughlin 2008, McAuley  <em>et al.</em> 2005).",Decreasing,NA,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Inshore fisheries are generally intensive throughout this species' inshore range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Spottail Shark is captured as both a target species and as bycatch in northern Australian shark, finfish and prawn fisheries, although current catch rates are highly unlikely to threaten the Australian population. Historically, Spottail Shark contributed about 20% by number to the Taiwanese gillnet fishery that operated in Australian waters between 1979 and 1986 (Stevens and Davenport 1991). This fishery's annual catch was about 7,000 t processed weight of shark, tuna and mackerel. Sharks comprised about 80% of the total catch with <em>C. sorrah</em> and <em>C. tilstoni</em> accounting for about 60% (20% and 40% respectively). CPUE of sharks declined from 11 kg/km in 1979 to 3 kg/km in 1984 and then increased to about 6 kg/km in 1986, (Stevens and Davenport 1991). Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities have greatly increased in northern Australian waters in recent years. Indonesian fishers are increasingly fishing illegally in this area, the majority of whom are targeting shark (although a few target reef fish and trepang) (AMFA 2007, Vince 2007).<br/><br/>Spottail Shark is commonly caught in the Indonesian artisanal fisheries and marketed (White <em>et al</em>. 2006) but at a lower level than would have been expected for a typically very common species. Although this suggests a relatively low catch rate, there are no data on CPUE and it is therefore not possible to determine whether the low catches are due to small population size caused by overfishing. However, giving the extremely high level of fishing pressure in the Southeast Asian region and the problem of habitat degradation in inshore waters throughout much of its range (not Australia), this species is likely to be under great pressure. Nursery areas are extremely important for Spottail Shark, with juveniles inhabiting shallow inshore waters until they attain a larger size. These nursery areas are heavily fished in areas such as Indonesia and are also extremely susceptible to habitat degradation and even pollution, especially adjacent to riverine areas. This species is one of the dominant shark species in the landings of fisheries in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. Most Spottail Sharks captured in these fisheries are immature (SEAFDEC 2006).<br/><br/>Threats to the species' inshore habitat from fishing pressure and habitat degradation are also high in many areas within its range in the Indian Ocean, for example India, where inshore marine species are thought to be fully or overexploited, with extensive use of illegal mesh sizes reported (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). India's inshore fisheries are generally characterised by declining catch rates, declining recruitment and biomass, and a shift from regular landing patterns (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Sharks are heavily fished in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Fisheries have experienced increased demand for sharks in recent years due to the shark fin trade and effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas as a result (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bonfil and Abdullah 2004). Spottail Shark was the third most important species of shark in traditional fishery landings of the Sultanate of Oman during a study from January 2002 to December 2003, although landings between areas were highly variable (Henderson <em>et al. </em>2007).",None in place through much of its range. Fisheries catching this species in northern Australia are relatively well managed and reporting of catches is good.,Unknown,"Population genetic studies of Indonesian and Australian populations have shown that they are different stocks (Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, unpubl. data). Genetic evidence suggested that this species forms one population in Australian waters (Lavery and Shacklee 1989). Tagging studies off Northern Australia have shown that 49% of sharks were recaptured within 50 km of the tagging site, however one shark was captured 1,116 km away (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2000). These authors also showed that most animals moved along the coastline. Data from this study suggests that although there was sufficient movement to prevent stock differentiation, the degree of movement was not great enough to prevent a reduction in local populations as a result of heavy fishing pressure. This conclusion contradicts those of Lavery and Shacklee (1989) who had concluded that local populations would be well buffered by immigration of sharks from other areas and that under high fishing pressure, total population size rather than local population size was likely to be the limiting factor affecting production.<br/><br/>Further stock discrimination and assessment throughout its whole range is required. Variation in vertebral counts and litter sizes between <em>C. sorrah</em> in the Red Sea and southwestern Indian Ocean may suggest relatively isolated populations there, but this requires confirmation (Compagno in prep).<br/><br/>Very common off northern Australia.

The species is highly regarded as a food fish in Japan, but not in the western Atlantic. It is caught primarily with line fishing gear, but is also taken in bottom-set gillnets and trawls. The meat is utilised fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried and salted, for human consumption. This species has also been used for fishmeal, its liver for oil, and its fins for making soup via the oriental sharkfin trade (Compagno 1984a).<br/><br/>This species has been taken along the Atlantic coast of the United States in a commercial shark fishery directed towards a wide array of large coastal species, but supported primarily by catches of <em>Carcharhinus plumbeus</em> and <em>C. limbatus</em>. Musick <em>et al.</em> (1993) showed that several species of sharks, including the sand tiger, had declined by as much as 75% during the decade from 1980-1990 because of overfishing. Recently, this fishery has come under management and <em>C. taurus</em> has been accorded full protection (see below).<br/><br/>In the 1850s, this species was fished by hook-and-line in and around Botany Bay, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, during October and November, to provide a source of oil """"of excellent quality for burning in lamps"""" (Grant 1982). In the late 1920s this species was also fished, together with other shark species, at Port Stephens, NSW (Roughley 1955). It was the second most commonly captured shark after the whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae) in this area. According to Roughley (1955), Grey Nurse Sharks produced the best quality shark leather but their fins were not as desirable as those from some of the other sharks commonly caught in this fishery. Commercial fishing for <em>C. taurus</em> reputedly continued on and off in NSW using various methods up until the Second World War.<br/><br/>Pepperell (1992) summarised catch records of gamefishermen in south-eastern Australia and found that <em>C. taurus</em> constituted 11% (161 sharks) of the total recorded shark catch (1,461) during the 1960s and 7% (244 sharks) in the 1970s (total catch 3,466 sharks). The weights of <em>C. taurus</em> specimens caught by game fishermen ranged from less than 10 to around 190 kg (Pepperell 1992). Capture of this species was banned voluntarily by game fishermen throughout Australia in 1979 (Pepperell 1992).<br/><br/>Meshing of beaches was instituted in NSW in the late 1930s to protect bathers from shark attack (Reid and Krough 1992). Since then, shark meshing has also been adopted in Queensland, Australia (Paterson 1986) and in Natal, South Africa (Cliff and Dudley 1992). <em>Carcharias taurus</em> comprised 3.8% (n = 369) of the total NSW (i.e. Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong area) beach meshing catch of sharks from 1950-1990 (Reid and Krough 1992). The number of <em>C. taurus</em> taken in these mesh nets in NSW over this 40-year period is thus slightly less than that taken by game fishermen during the 1960s and 1970s. Overall, there have been large declines over time in the meshing catch and catch per unit effort for the species. During the early 1950s, 24-36 <em>C. taurus</em> were meshed per year, but since the late 1970s only 0-3 were caught each year (Pollard <em>et al.</em> 1996). Prior to this 40-year period, Coppleson (1958) reported 58 Grey Nurse Sharks being caught in these beach meshing nets between October and December 1937.<br/><br/>Cliff and Dudley (1992) reported an average annual catch of 246 spotted ragged tooth sharks in the Natal (South Africa) beach meshing programme for the period 1978-1990, with 38% of the catch being found alive in the nets. Whenever possible these live sharks were released, many with tags. Between 1966-1972 there was a significant decline in the catch rate of this species, followed by a significant increase between 1972-1990 (Dudley and Cliff 1993a). Maximum and minimum catches were 20 (1966) and two (1981) sharks per km of net per year (Dudley and Cliff 1993a).<br/><br/>Interactions between skindivers and <em>C. taurus</em> in Australia are nowadays rare. There are reports of Grey Nurse Sharks stealing speared fish from skindivers, but this is not common. During the 1950s and 1960s, however, skin and SCUBA divers armed with barbless or barbed spears, hypodermic spears containing strychnine nitrate, and especially explosive powerheads, killed many <em>C. taurus</em> off the NSW coast (Cropp 1964). Divers also took them alive, often with lassos, to sell to aquariums (Cropp 1964). <em>Carcharias taurus</em> are still taken, under permit, for aquariums (Smith 1992), but with the assigning of their protected status (see later) and an increased awareness of the need for their conservation, there are now no reports of divers killing these sharks deliberately.<br/><br/>Because of its large size and fearsome appearance, and because it occurs in relatively shallow water where it often hovers almost motionless near the sea floor, <em>C. taurus</em> can be readily approached and is now a very popular attraction with SCUBA divers. Dive guides tend to highlight locations where these sharks regularly occur (e.g., Byron 1985), and divers can observe <em>C. taurus</em> at the same locations on many occasions, suggesting a high degree of site-attachment by these sharks. On the other hand, concern has been expressed (most recently in South Africa) that disturbance by divers may be detrimental to natural behaviour patterns and could even result in the exclusion of some sharks from critical habitat and/or important refuge areas (Andrew Cobb in litt.).","<em>Carcharias taurus</em> was protected in NSW in 1984 because of serious declines in the population due to commercial and recreational fishing, spearfishing and beach meshing. In early 1997, the Queensland State Government also declared <em>C. taurus</em> a totally protected species in that State's waters, and the Australian Commonwealth Government followed suit with protection of <em>C. taurus</em> as a Vulnerable species in all Commonwealth waters and throughout Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (i.e., out to two hundred nautical miles offshore). Also in 1997, <em>C. taurus</em> received full protection on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA, under the Atlantic Fishery Management Plan. The main current threat to this species in south-eastern Australia is probably the accidental (bycatch) capture of juveniles by recreational line fishers.",Unknown,NA,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

As a consequence of this typically exaggerated threat to human safety and an almost legendary """"Big Fish"""" status, the species is targeted as a source for sports-fishing, commercial drumline trophy-hunting (for jaws, teeth and even entire specimens preserved), sporadic human consumption or merely as the piscine whipping-boy of individuals pandering to shark attack paranoia. All of these activities have greatly increased since the """"JAWS"""" media phenomenon of the mid 1970s, not only to the detriment of <em>C. carcharias</em> but also in encouraging targeting of other, less high-profile species. Nowhere is the Great White Shark abundant and productive enough to sustain long-term directed fisheries; the majority of annual captures worldwide being made incidentally through commercial fisheries operating longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, fish-traps and other gear. The Great White Shark is ensnared throughout the water column in nearshore fisheries but, notably, is rarely represented in the elasmobranch bycatch of offshore oceanic pelagic fisheries (unlike Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>) and Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>)). The Great White Shark is vulnerable to capture trauma and may be killed or has limited survivorship after capture. Great White Sharks are curious and readily approach boats, scavenge from fishermens' nets or longlines and devour hooked fish taken by rod-and-line or swordfish harpoon. This vulnerable propensity often results in either their own accidental entrapment or deliberate killing by commercial fishermen. In certain regions the Great White Shark has traditionally been viewed negatively as manifesting a costly interference to fisheries, although some fishers appreciate it for its role in eating pinnipeds that devour their catches. This species is unquestionably vulnerable to directed exploitation such as sports fisheries, the curio trade, the oriental shark-fin trade and even the public aquarium trade. The overall, long-term impact of these causes of mortality upon regional populations, coupled to those caused through indirect fishery captures or protective beach meshing, is probably detrimental. The removal of even a few individuals apparently has very tangible effect at discrete localities (such as the Farallon Islands, California, based upon observations following the cull of four local sharks in 1984 (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1985)). Habitat degradation (development, pollution and overfishing) also threatens this species and may largely exclude it from areas, perhaps traditionally utilised for feeding or as nurseries, where it was historically much more abundant. Great White Sharks have been sought as the ultimate species to display in large public oceanaria, but with poor survivorship so far. Directed fishery exploitation of Great White Sharks is primarily undertaken with the aim of trading its teeth and jaws as trophies or curios and its fins for the oriental fin trade. In South Africa offers of US$20,000-$50,000 have been made for great white shark jaws and US$600-$800 for individual teeth. Apart from their size, Great White Shark products in the form of curios and fins are boosted in value because of notoriety. A fin-set from a large great white shark may be valued at over US$1,000. Unfortunately, as with rhino horns and elephant tusks, the high value of Great White Shark products encourages poaching, clandestine trade and flouting of protective laws (Compagno 2001). Comparative data of catch-rates and CPUE are sketchy or lacking for most of the Great White Shark's range, although some figures are available from select regions. Observations of game fishery captures in south-east Australia between 1961-1990 indicate a catch-ratio from 1:22 in the 1960s, declining to 1:38 in the 1970s and 1:651in the 1980s (Pepperell 1992), suggesting a possible decline in abundance. South Australian game-fishing catches from 1980-1990 averaged 1.4 sharks per year and has declined since the 1950s, possibly through a reduction in effort (Bruce 1992). Sydney game fishing catches have ranged from 0-17 between 1950-1980, with no significant trend. Commercial bycatches off Australia are suspected to be the largest cause of mortality to Australian Great White Sharks, although without any data to currently substantiate this claim (J.D. Stevens and B. Bruce pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Recent tagging off South Australia (70-90 animals tagged) has demonstrated a 4-6% recapture rate (Stevens and Bruce pers. Comm.), which may be considered cause for concern. Approximately 40% of 126 Great White Sharks tagged at Dyer Island or Struisbaai, South Africa, between 1992-94 were resighted (Compagno unpubl.). Both the Australian and African research demonstrates at least short-term residency and site-affinity with some pronounced seasonality, coupled to more irregular nomadicity. Off the eastern USA, NMFS statistics from 1965-1983 show a decline from 1:67-1:210 (Casey and Pratt 1985), suggesting a possible decline in abundance. Data from beach meshing programmes in NSW and Queensland show a gradual and irregular decline in CPUE since the 1960s (J.D. Stevens and B. Bruce pers. comm.) whilst trends in KwaZulu-Natal meshing programmes are variable and less clear, but essentially downwards. Other indices of catch-rates are available from: California, between 1960-1985 as 0-14 sharks per year (mean 3.2, Klimley 1985), KwaZulu-Natal, between 1974-1988 as 22-61 sharks per year (Cliff <em>et al. </em>1989) and the Central Mediterranean Sea (Sicilian Channel), between 1950-1994 as 0-8 sharks per year (mean 2.2, Fergusson unpubl.). We presently have no complete data for Japan, New Zealand or Chile. In other areas, catches are much more nominal and very sporadic (e.g., Brazil, Hawaii).","The Great White Shark is currently protected in the Australian EEZ and state waters, South Africa, Namibia, Israel, Malta and the USA (California and Florida states, with directed fisheries prohibited off all coasts). Protective laws are strict, but loopholes and inadequate enforcement causes problems including promoting the black-market for high-value Great White Shark products including jaws, teeth and fins. Australia has developed a comprehensive and multidisciplinary recovery plan for great white sharks in its waters (Compagno 2001). A proposal to list the great white shark in CITES, to regulate or ban international trade failed in 2000, but Australia has since listed the species in Appendix III. A CITES listing might help slow trade in great white shark products, but will not eliminate low volume criminal trade. The Great White Shark was added to both Appendices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) in 2002 with the objective of providing a framework for the coordination of measures adopted by range states to improve the conservation of the species (Government of Australia 2002). The great white shark should be removed from international game fish record lists, and needs consistently rational and realistic treatment by entertainment and news media to counter its notoriety and inflated market value.",Unknown,NA,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

This species is utilized in the eastern Atlantic, and captured there in bottom trawls and with fixed bottom nets and line gear (Compagno in prep.). It is potentially threatened in any area where there is a targeted fishery.<br/><br/>The Portuguese longline fishery which targets Black Scabbard Fish (<em>Aphanopus carbo</em>) at depths of 800-1,200 m off the coast of Portugal (ICES Subarea IX) takes a bycatch of the deepwater sharks, including <em>Centrophorus</em> species (ICES 2007). A Spanish longline fishery for <em>Pagellus bogaraveo</em> and a bottom trawl fishery off southern Portugal, which targets some deepwater crustaceans also take a bycatch of deepwater sharks (ICES 2007). In 2006 a new deep-water gillnet fishery was also initiated in this area and in waters northwest of Spain (ICES 2007). Off Portugal (ICES Subarea IX) the target species of this fishery are deep-water crab (283 tons) and several deep-water sharks (135 tons, plus 31 tons of livers and oil) (ICES 2007).<br/><br/>Identification problems mean that this species is commonly confused with its congener <em>C. granulosus</em>. <em>C. granulosus</em> is estimated to have undergone declines of 80-95% where it is fished in the northeast Atlantic. ICES (2006) landings data from the Portuguese coast show a strong estimated decline in <em>C. granulosus</em> catch from about 1,000 t in 1990 to less than 100 t in 2004 (Guallart <em>et al</em>. 2006). As <em>C. lusitanicus</em> is present along with <em>C. granulosus</em> in the Portuguese fishery it is highly likely that it has also been impacted. <em>Centrophorus</em> spp are very slow to mature, have extremely low fecundity and reproductive output, making them intrinsically very vulnerable to population depletion (longevity &gt;30 years and one pup produced every two years). This is a large, heavy-built species (possibly reaches greater than 1 m length) and may therefore be even more biologically vulnerable to depletion than other <em>Centrophorus</em> species.<br/><br/>Deepwater fisheries also operate in the Eastern Central Atlantic and deepwater sharks are known to be targeted in some areas off Senegal. Off Kayar and Dakar, Senegal, an artisanal fishery targets <em>Centrophorus</em> species (including <em>C. lusitanicus</em>) for their liver oil (Direction des Pêches Maritimes du Sénégal 2007). The fishery uses gillnets to target deepwater sharks for part of the year. Fisheries are beginning to operate in deeper waters due to declines in catches of more coastal species (L. Mbaye pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>There is an upper slope fishery off Mauritania for hake that takes <em>Centrophorus</em> species as a bycatch (Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Important species within this group are <em>Centrophorus granulosus</em>, <em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>, <em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>, <em>Centroscymnus crepidater</em>, <em>Dalatias licha</em>, <em>Deania profundorum</em>, and <em>Deania calcea</em>. In their study of landed bycatch from this fishery from 1992-2001, Fernández <em>et al</em>. (2005) report that the catch of these squalids declined from 158 tons (87% of elasmobranch landings) in 1992 to 22 tons (59%) in 2001, with a minimum of 3.5 tons in 1999. The decline may be attributable to a set of factors, including a shift in the depths fished, economic reasons (the value and quality of elasmobranch landings fell during the period of the study) and probable over-exploitation of both the target and bycatch species. The fishery operates from 140-750 m depth, but currently tends to work at increasingly greater depths (with some variation according to the seasonal tides, and a recent average depth of up to 710 m per tide (2003 data from observers on commercial vessels)). Although this species is not currently reported from Mauritania, the trend for fisheries to expand into deeper waters in the Eastern Central Atlantic is of concern. Other fleets from Spain and other countries are also fishing in this area with both fresh and freezer vessels focusing on other demersal and semipelagic stocks, but little information is available to assess their impact on demersal stocks (Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005).","No measures in place.

This shark has been exploited commercially for many years. In Japan exploitation peaked during World War II, because of the high percentage of squalene in its liver, but quickly declined due to decreasing numbers caught. Deep-water fisheries (longlining and trawling) which catch large quantities of this species are found in the eastern Atlantic, e.g., off Ireland, Spain, Portugal and France (Iglesias and Paz 1995, Clarke et al. 2001, Girard and De Buit 1999). For example, this species is targeted heavily by the Portuguese deep-water longline fishery for which exploitation peaked in 1986 (600 tonnes) and has been steadily declining since then (Correia and Smith, in prep). The catches of the mixed trawl fishery off Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank in the eastern Atlantic, which consist predominantly of this species and Centroscymnus coelolepis, increased from 302 tonnes in 1991 to 3,284 tonnes in 1996, and then declined to 1,939 tonnes in 1999 (ICES 2000). Although this suggests that the population is declining, this data cannot be directly related to fishing effort and it is therefore possible that fishing effort declined between 1996 and 1999. The French bottom trawl fishery has shown rapidly increasing landings of these species, i.e., 322 tonnes in 1990 and 2,939 tonnes in 1996 (Girard and De Buit 1999). Quantitative catch per unit effort are available for autoline catches in ICES Area VI: 218 (1997) to 24 (2000); 219 (1998) to 42 (2000) = 80 to 90% decline in three years. Area VII: 221(96), 56 (97), 51 (99), 73 (00) = 67 to 77% decline in four years. Area XII: 100 (1999), 78 and 31 (2000) = 20 to 69% decline in one year (SGRST 2002). Although this data is for C. squamosus and Centroscymnus coelolepis combined, the acute vulnerability to exploitation of Centrophorus spp has been shown from the New South Wales (NSW) fishery independent surveys (Graham et al. 2001), and C. squamosus is the more vulnerable of these two species in terms of life history. <br/> <br/>Artisanal deep-water longline fisheries in eastern Indonesia, e.g., Java and Bali, also commonly land this species but often in low numbers (W. White, unpubl. data). The catches of this species in Australia and Oceania are relatively low and do not represent a significant component of the squaloid catch in both southeastern Australia and New Zealand, however more data is required. <br/> <br/>The flesh and liver are marketed from this species in many areas throughout its range.","Detailed quantitative information on catch per unit effort for Centrophorus squamosus throughout its range is required to assess whether CPUE is declining. The only information available on catch rates records tonnage landed annually on Rockall Trough and Porcupine Bank in the eastern Atlantic, but this cannot be related to effort and, thus, cannot be used to determine whether population sizes are decreasing. A stock analysis will be available shortly from the DELASS project in the North East Atlantic. It should also be noted that due to the apparently long lifespan of this species, the recovery of a heavily fished population would probably require a long period of time.",Decreasing,NA,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Annual average catch recommendations not to exceed: Tabasco 2,300 t, Campeche 2,100 t, Veracruz 1,500 t, Quintana Roo 127 t, Tamaulipas and Yucatan 100 t.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) manages the snook fishery throughout the state of Florida. The aim of the FWC is to maintain the status of the snook stock to a spawning potential ratio (SPR) of 40% or more.

In the northeast Atlantic <em>C. fabricii</em> is frequently taken as bycatch in deepwater trawl and longline fisheries; however bycatch data is scarcely available.<br/><br/>ICES (2005) gives full description of the mixed trawl, deepwater gillnet and mixed and directed longline fisheries operating in the northeast Atlantic. Many of these fisheries operate throughout much of the species' geographic range in this area and bycatch pressure is likely to be significant. For example, off Iceland, a considerable amount of <em>C. fabricii</em>, are likely to be discarded by the commercial fishery for Greenland halibut <em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>. Records are rare and purely incidental, but Jakobsdottir (2001) estimated a bycatch of 98 and 109 t in 1996 and 1997 respectively based on trawl surveys in the area. Records of the catch proportions of the fleet in this area are needed for a full evaluation of the level of discarding of this species.<br/><br/><em>C. fabricii,</em> are landed by the French trawl fishery for mixed deep-water species. Initially this fishery was conducted in ICES sub-areas VIa, VIIc,k but in 2001 when the Irish deep-water trawl fishery started to operate in Subarea VII most of the French fishing fleet moved to Subarea VIa (ICES 2005). In sub-area  XII there have been some French landings of deep-water sharks, but it is not possible to detect any trends from the available data (ICES 2005). Note that this Sub-area contains both the western part of Hatton Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES 2005) where this species is known to occur. Landings in France (mainly from division Vb and sub-area VI) decreased from about 250 t in 2000 to nearly 30 t in 2004 (ICES 2005). Iceland reported few landings from division Va and the largest annual landings reported by Spain came from sub-area XII in 2000 (85 Tonnes) and 2001 (91 tonnes) (ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Despite the more northerly distribution exhibited by this species, concerns still exist that this species will be vulnerable to the growing trend of the French deep-water trawl and other fisheries to operate in deeper waters to the west of the British Isles. Furthermore, there is still a lack of data available on incidental catches. Although <em>C. fabricii</em> has higher ovarian fecundities than other squalid sharks of its size, females still attain a large size at first maturity (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2005), and therefore this species may also be subjected to overfishing by the deep-water fishery.<br/><br/>The species is occasionally taken as a bycatch off southern Africa, but generally occurs in deepwater beyond the hake fishery zone. The species is not considered to be threatened in this region; however the situation should be monitored if fisheries expand into deeper waters. There is little information on catches of this species in the eastern central Atlantic.<br/><br/><strong>Western Atlantic</strong><br/>In the northwest Atlantic, the species is taken as bycatch in a number of fisheries. In Canadian waters, there is no directed fishery but <em>C. fabricii </em>are taken as bycatch in a number of fisheries, primarily the Greenland halibut <em>R. hippoglossoides</em>, crab, redfish, monkfish and witch fisheries where removals averaged a total of 68t annually between 1996 and 2005 (Kulka 2006).<br/><br/>In the NRA, there are no data on removals but bycatch would be significant on the <em>R. hippoglossoides</em> fishing grounds (Kulka 2006). Based on distributional information, it is expected that most of the fish that would be captured in the fisheries in the NRA slope waters would be large juveniles or adults (Kulka 2006). Samples from the Russian <em>R. hippoglossoides</em> fleet in the NRA support this (Kulka 2006). Although incidental catch of this species in the NRA has not yet been quantified, recent population trends of adults have been stable (Kulka 2006).<br/><br/>Little information is available on threats in the southwest Atlantic Ocean.","This species is included in the total allowable catch (TACs) set for deepwater sharks by ICES in the Northeast Atlantic: In 2007, the TAC for deepwater sharks in sub-areas V, VI, VII, VIII and IX is 2,472 t. In 2008, the TAC for these species in these areas will be reduced to 1,646 t. In 2007 and 2008, the TAC for deepwater sharks is set at 20 t annually in Sub-area X, and 99 t in sub-area XII (ICES 2007). <br/><br/>Recommendations: Like many deeper water species, more information on biology, ecology and importance in fisheries are required to further assess future conservation needs.",Unknown,"<strong>Eastern Atlantic</strong><br/>Although not commonly encountered, the species is found on the slope from central Africa to Iceland (Kulka 2006). In Icelandic waters it is most abundant off the west, southwest and southeast coasts (Jakobsdottir 2001).<br/><br/>Exhibits size structure segregation by depth for both sexes off Iceland with the smallest immature specimens found at 1,000 and 1,500 m, and larger individuals at depths in between. The overall sex ratio off Iceland was 1.00:1.19 in favour of females. Males were more numerous in shallower waters but in depths >1,000 m, the sex ratio was significantly in favour of females (Jakobsdottir 2001).<br/><br/>The species is apparently abundant off southern Africa, mainly below 500 m depth. There is some uncertainty as to whether the Southeast Atlantic and the Northeast Atlantic populations are in fact the same species.<br/><br/><strong>Western Atlantic</strong><br/>Abundant on the upper and middle slope and along the Mid Atlantic Ridge (Kulka 2006). Common off southwest Greenland (Yano 1995) and Baffin Island, in slope waters off Labrador, Newfoundland, the Scotian Shelf and Georges Bank (Kulka 2006). In the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Fisheries Organisation Regulatory Area (NRA), <em>C. fabricii</em> occupy an area of 225,000 km² and are highly abundant in the Laurentian Channel where they are 10 times more densely concentrated than in the Grand Banks or Labrador Shelf slope waters (Kulka 2006). Recent population trends of adults in the NRA have been stable (Kulka 2006).<br/><br/>According to Kulka (2006), in Canadian waters, large (pregnant) females migrate to the shallow (<400 m) portion of the Laurentian Channel where pupping occurs. The young then move into deeper waters of the channel. As they mature they move onto the slope, moving great distances north from the Grand Banks to the Labrador Shelf into deeper waters of the slope as they grow. The exception to this pattern is an area west of Greenland where juveniles of all sizes have been found in slope waters (Yano 1995). Kulka (2006) has suggested that there may be two separate stocks off Greenland and Canada even though the distribution is continuous between the two.

A shift to smaller size classes was observed from the early 1990s to 2001, suggesting an impact from the increased fishing pressure. Despite this, the population appears to be resilient (Trott and Luckhurst 2007). In St. Lucia in&#160;2005, landings for this species totaled&#160;4.6 tons (S. Scott pers. comm.). In Navassa Island, which is a U.S. National Wildlife Refuge near Haiti, this species was considered common in the 1970s and 1990s, but was rare during a study conducted by McClellan and Miller in 2002, and preliminary analyses suggests this was due to overfishing (Miller 2003). In Puerto Rico, the government reported landings of 2,687; 1,925; 1,545; 2,237; and 2,401 lbs for the years 2007-2011, respectively (Matos-Caraballo 2012).<br/><strong><br/>Gulf of Mexico: </strong>This species is common in the Gulf of Mexico, and is not generally targeted by fisheries due to its relatively small size. An underwater survey conducted in Sabana Cabaguey, Cuba, recorded a decline of 152 to 5 individuals from 1988-2000, which may be related to coral bleaching events (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Brazil: </strong>This species is apparently naturally rare in&#160;St. Paul’s Rocks, but is very common in Fernando de Noronha (Feitoza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Freitas&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) found genetic connectivity between&#160;the Atol das Rocas and the Northeastern Brazilian Coasts. Souza <em>et al. </em>(2015) also found strong gene flow among six localities along Brazil from the northeast coast to the southwest coast, including the oceanic islands of Rocas Atoll and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago.&#160;This was the most abundant serranid observed during underwater surveys conducted on Brazilian reefs, and was significantly more abundant in no take areas (Ferreira&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Ferreira and Maida 2006). Underwater surveys were conducted from 2002 to 2015 at depths shallower than 27 metres in the main coral reef areas in Brazil (Maracajau, Apa Costa dos Corais, Itaparica, Abrolhos, Porto Seguro, Atol das Rocas and Fernando de Noronha); from Rio Grande do Norte to Bahia and including oceanic islands, higher densities of this species were recorded in protected oceanic islands (3.9 ind/100 m<sup>2</sup>; 7.9 ind/100 m<sup>2</sup>), and along the coast it ranged between 0.2 to 2.4 ind/100 m<sup>2</sup> (Reef Check Brazil data). This species was absent from shallow reefs at Abrolho, although reports from deeper areas indicate high abundance (R. Moura pers. comm. 2018). Underwater surveys conducted in Bahia in 2007 on Baixo-sul reefs reported elevated mean densities of this species of 4.89 fish/100 m<sup>2</sup> and frequencies of occurrence of 70.8% (A. Bertoncini unpublished data). Floeter <em>et al.</em> (2007) reported mean densities of up to 0.56 fish/40 m<sup>2</sup> for coastal islands along Espirito Santo, and Pinheiro<em> et al.</em> (2011), reported high mean densities of 11.51 fish/40 m<sup>2</sup> with a frequency of occurrence of 95.6% for the oceanic island of Trindade. Mean densities of this species were higher in the no-take area (4.1 fish/60 m<sup>2</sup>) as compared to the recreational use area (1.8 fish/60 m<sup>2</sup>) in the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (Ilarri <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/>It is a relatively abundant species taken in the line fishery operating between Cabo São Tomé and Salvador and also along the northeastern Brazilian coast, where it is the most abundant serranid registered in artisanal catches (Lessa and Nóbrega 2000). In northeastern Brazil, it represented 2.4% of the total abundance and occurred in 15% of artisanal catches overall (Fredou <em>et al.</em> 2006), although these figures may be underestimated, as this species is also used as live bait, consumed on board or taken home and thus not registered in statistics. In the 1990s, this was one of the most utilized species for live bait in commercial fisheries in northeast Brazil, however, it is now kept for personal consumption rather than utilized as bait&#160;(S. Rezende pers. comm.). It also represents 1.7% of the abundance of bycatch in the lobster fishery (Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2015). The collapse of the Abrolhos-Vitoria fisheries in the 1980s led fishers to turn to other resources, and by the end of the 1980s, a new market developed to target lutjanids and smaller serranids, including this species. Estimated landings of this species in the Abrolhos-Vitória area was 1,116 t/year, which is almost six times higher than reported in official statistics and catch per unit effort estimated for the region varied between 0.03 and 3.35 kg/fisher/day (Klippel <em>et al.</em> 2005). A research survey conducted from 1997-1999 off central Brazil concluded that the population was overexploited after commercial fisheries switched from targeting large grouper species to smaller reef fish species such as this (Araujo and Martins 2009). In Espírito Santo, official fisheries landings reported from April 2011 to March 2012, show a peak of production in October and November (38.1% and 17.6% of the data), where total landings totaled 41.8 tons (69% from line and hook gear), representing 0.34% of total landings of Espirito Santo’s production.

Priest<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2016) reported a genetic partition of eight mutational steps with nuclear gene analysis supporting a long period (approximately 880,000 years) of isolation between the two populations, which suggests the existence of a persistent barrier to dispersal. The absence of connectivity between regions may be due, in part, to the reproductive timing of&#160;the species. In the Gulf of Aqaba, spawning occurs in July and August (El-Etreby <em>et al</em>. 1993) and between May and July in Oman. During this same time, seasonal upwelling occurs along Oman's Arabian Sea coast, where sea surface temperatures can drop to 16 °C, which is well below the physiological tolerance of most tropical fish larvae. There are also marked demographic differences between the two populations, with the median fork length of individuals in the Red Sea population being 18 cm FL compared to 30 cm in the Oman/Persian Gulf population. However, the median age of the populations was similar (approximately 5-6 years), which indicates that the Gulf of Oman populations have very high growth rates over the first 5-6 years of life. There are also differences in meristic features and spawning times between the two populations. Exploitation&#160;levels also vary across the two populations. In the Red Sea region,&#160;<em>Cephalopholis hemistiktos</em>&#160;is part of the artisanal catch, but is generally not targeted due to its small size (Roberts and Polunin 1992, Gladstone 2002). In the Gulf of Oman-Persian Gulf region,&#160;<em>C. hemistikto</em>s is larger and actively targeted by commercial fisheries (Hashim 1993). While a full demographic assessment of&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos&#160;</em>is beyond the scope of this study, our results suggest that different management regimes are be needed within the spatial boundaries demarcated by genetic analyses (Priest <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>Saudi Arabia has reported 'yellowfin hind' to FAO annual landings statistics since 2000, but it is not known if these landings are from the Red Sea or Persian Gulf population, or both combined. Between 2000-2015, catch averaged 242 tons and showed no significant fluctuation or trend over the time period (FAO FishStatJ database accessed June 2017).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman population: </strong>This&#160;is the most abundant grouper species on reefs off Kuwait, in particular at Qaro Island; an average&#160;8-14 individuals were observed within a 200 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;transect (Carpenter&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1997). Records from the Gulf of Oman extending north beyond Musandam into the Arabian Gulf show that&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;is one of the most abundant species of&#160;<em>Cephalopholis</em>, but abundance patterns are highly variable in Oman.&#160;To the south of this area, abundance drops sharply and is absent from reefs in the Arabian Sea south of Ras al Hadd, Oman (J. McIlwain pers. comm. 2013). It is abundant in Oman, but patchily distributed on shallow coastal reefs, with the greatest abundance in the central region (Muscat) and smaller numbers in the Persian Gulf. It is heavily fished by line and trapping on the central Oman coast on the Gulf of Oman, but despite this local fishery in the upwelling area, it remains abundant (J. McIlwain pers. comm. 2015). Weekly sampling in the Muttrah market from March 2004 to March 2005 revealed&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;to be the most abundant grouper, accounting for 34% of all grouper that were measured (by number) (J. McIlwain pers. comm. 2015). During the same time period, sampling of the landings at Dibba in Musandam showed that&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;accounted for 16% of the total grouper landings. Logbooks filled out by Omani traditional fishermen from Barka (35 km north of Muscat) suggests&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;accounts for 7.5% of the total catch (all fish species combined) and 42% of grouper species.&#160;In Oman, this species accounts for 42% of the total grouper catch in some areas (J. McIlwain unpublished data). A reef fish underwater survey conducted from 1985 to 1987 at three nearshore (Abu Ali, Manifa, and Tarut Bay) and two offshore (Jana and Karan Islands) sites in Saudi Arabia reported the mean abundance of&#160;<em>Cephalopholis hemistiktos</em>&#160;as 7.52 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;at the offshore sites, while no individuals were observed at the nearshore sites (Coles and Tarr 1990). Another underwater fish survey conducted at nearshore and offshore areas off Saudi Arabia, reported&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;from all offshore sites with a&#160;mean abundance of 6.7 individuals per 100 m<sup>2 </sup>(Krupp and&#160;Müller 1994). Krupp and Almarri (1996) continued the survey initiated by Krupp and&#160;Müller&#160;(1994), and determined the mean abundance of&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;at Karan Island&#160;to be 6 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1992, 6.2&#160;in 1993, 6.3&#160;in 1994 and 5.8<sup>&#160;</sup>in 1995. Based on these three studies, mean abundance of this species in offshore areas of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf ranged from 7.5 in 1986 to 5.8 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1995, which is about a 23% reduction over a period of about ten years; it is not known if this represents an actual population decline. During underwater surveys conducted in 2010 at Saudi reefs (north of Qatar), 50 counts over coral reefs resulted in zero sightings of&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>; the species<em>&#160;</em>was not recorded in inshore reefs, nor from Saudi coral reefs north of Qatar. At Halul Island, an offshore island of Qatar, the abundance of&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;was&#160;0.8 individuals per 250 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Ayling unpub. data 2010 via J. Choat pers. comm. 2013). Underwater surveys conducted in October and November 2008 reported the mean abundance&#160;of&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;in the southern Persian Gulf as&#160;0.3 individuals per 150 m<sup>2 </sup>(Feary&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).

Grandcourt, J. McIlwain and M. Priest pers. comm. 2015). The mean age and size at first sexual maturity for females was&#160;13 years and 25.3 cm total length (Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013).&#160;These small differences between size at first capture and first maturity reflect the asymptotic nature of the growth curves, but the age at first maturity may be an overestimate (E. Grandcourt pers. comm. 2015). Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;(2013) also estimated&#160;the natural, fishing and total mortality as&#160;0.21, 0.17 and 0.38 year<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Juvenile retention rate of this species in the demersal trap fishery was 40.2%&#160;(Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013).

Considering this evidence, Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2013) concluded&#160;<em>C. hemistiktos</em>&#160;as overexploited even though&#160;it&#160;is a minor component of Persian Gulf demersal trap fisheries.</p><p> Abu Dhabi aggregate serranid landings were 1,233 metric tons in 2001 and 1,240 mt in 2004.

(2002c) describes historical and modern fisheries. The Basking Shark has been exploited for several centuries to supply liver oil for lighting and industrial use, skin for leather and flesh for food or fishmeal. Modern fisheries yield liver oil, fins, meat and cartilage (Rose 1996, Anon. 2002c). The large liver represents 17-25% of total weight and contains a high proportion of squalene oil (Buranudeen and Richards-Rajadurai 1986). The very large fins fetch extremely high prices in international trade to East Asia (Fleming and Papageorgiou 1996, Lum 1996, Fairfax 1998, Anon. 2002c). Targeted basking shark fisheries entangle them in nets or use non-explosive harpoon guns to take sharks on the surface. Incidental catches are utilised when there is a market for the products and there has been an unutilised """"eradication"""" fishery. Catches have been recorded from Norway, Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Iceland, Canada, California, Peru, Ecuador, China and Japan (Compagno 1984a, Anon. 1999). One fishery in the Northeast Atlantic continues to take small numbers (ICES data, see Anon. 2002c). Most Basking Shark fisheries appear to have collapsed after initial high yields, and this species is considered by Compagno (1984a) to be extremely vulnerable to overfishing - perhaps more so than most other sharks. A small fishery off Monterey Bay, California (Northeast Pacific), produced fishmeal and shark liver oil between 1924-1937. It expanded from 1946 to early 1950s, taking about 200 sharks annually. A drop in market prices for shark liver reportedly made the operation uneconomic. R. Lea (pers. comm.) reports that basking shark sightingsoff central California over the past 20 years are less numerous than in the past. The population may not have recovered from a substantial depletion during the 1940s and 1950s fishery and could still be affected by bycatch. S. van Sommeran (pers. comm.) notes that finned carcasses are occasionally reported.<br/><br/>Basking Sharks are common in the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples of Vancouver Island, Canadian Pacific. Salmon net fishermen in Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island, complained of damage through accidental basking shark catches in the 1940s. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans instigated a shark eradication programme in the 1950s. Clemens and Wilby (1961) state that Fisheries vessels killed """"several hundred"""" in Barkley Sound up to 1959, to reduce salmon net bycatch. Darling and Keogh (1994) state """"Basking sharks are rarely sighted in Barkley Sound today, suggesting that the majority of the population in that area were killed."""" It seems that this stock of Basking Sharks was significantly depleted over a period of just a few years and has not yet recovered. A summer Basking Shark fishery started at Achill Island, western Ireland in 1947, using set nets to entangle sharks. It peaked in the early 1950s, when 1,000-1,808 sharks were taken each year. In the early 1970s only 29-85 sharks were taken annually, a decline of over 90% in 20-25 years. Re-capitalisation of the fishery in 1973 failed to increase yields locally and it closed in 1975, despite high oil prices. Parker and Stott (1965) and Horsman (1987) attributed the decline and collapse of this fishery to the overfishing of a local stock. Berrow and Heardman (1994) noted that there were still very few observations of basking sharks along the whole west and north-west coast of Ireland in 1993, and Achill Island fishermen reported fewer than 10 sharks sighted annually (Earll pers. comm.). This fishery appears to have depleted the population to such an extent that it has still not recovered some 40 years later. A wide-ranging Norwegian fleet has undertaken the major basking shark fishery in the northeast Atlantic from April to September in most years. Catches were high (&gt;1,000 and up to &gt;4,000) from 1959-1980 (Kunzlik 1988, ICES data, in Anon. 2002c). The Norwegian quota in European Community waters was 800 t (liver weight) in 1982, 400 t (approximately 800-1,000 sharks) in 1985, subsequently reduced to 200 t, 100 t, and to zero in 2001. Because basking sharks are taken by fishing vessels targeting small whales, increased restrictions on whaling activities and ageing vessels have reduced fleet size. The decline in this fishery has also been attributed to the falling value of Basking Shark liver oil, as a result of the competition from deepwater shark fisheries. Landings rose slightly in the early 1990s, when the fishery was being sustained by high fin prices (ICES 1995), but have since declined to very low levels, despite steeply increasing fin values. The majority of fins landed by Norway have been exported to Japan (Anon. 2002c). Since the precise location from which the basking sharks were taken is only identified by ICES sea area, it is difficult to detect and evaluate trends in catches, effort, and hence population, but the declines appear to be related to population trends and driven by fisheries and trade demand (Anon. 2002c). An intensive targeted Japanese Basking Shark fishery, utilising liver oil, shark fin and meat, took place in spring off Nakiri, Shima Peninsula, in the 1960s and 1970s. An estimated 1,200 sharks were harpooned from 1967-1978, peaking in 1972 when more than 60 sharks were sold at market in one day. Catches declined from about 150 sharks in 1975, to 20 in 1976, nine in 1977 and six in 1978. The fishery closed a few years later. In the 1990s, only 0-2 Basking Sharks were being sighted each year off Nakiri during migration (Yano 1976, 1979, Uchida 1995). Basking sharks are sometimes landed and sold after becoming entangled in set nets or pot lines, or caught in trawls, but bycatch (whether landed or discarded) is rarely reported. Exceptions are reports by Lien and Fawcett (1986) on an incidental fishery for basking sharks by salmon and cod set nets and deepwater trawls in Newfoundland, and Francis and Duffy (2002) on incidental capture in deepwater fisheries off New Zealand. Incidental shark catches in Newfoundland increased in 1981 when a market developed for the fins and liver. When there is no market for the sharks' fins and livers, salmon fishermen generally remove their gear from the water to prevent damage when basking sharks are known to be in the area. If there is a market, any sharks caught are killed and landed. <br/><br/>Berrow (1994) estimated that 77-120 sharks are taken annually in the bottom set gillnet fishery in the Celtic Sea. Fairfax (1998) reports that basking sharks are sometimes brought up from deepwater trawls near the Scottish west coast during winter. Bycatch in Isle of Man herring fishery is about 10-15 fish annually and a further 4-5 entangled in pot lines, (K. Watterson in litt.). Local fishermen estimate an unreported bycatch of up to 40 Basking Sharks per year in one large bay in south-west England (C. Speedie pers. comm.). In contrast to these relatively large coastal bycatches, observer data from oceanic gillnet fleets suggest that only about 50 Basking Sharks were among the several million sharks taken annually offshore in the Pacific Ocean (Bonfil 1994). Habitat loss or degradation is not considered to be a serious problem for this species.<br/><br/>Following notes added by Lucy Harrison (iucnshark@gmail.com) via Sarah Fowler May 17th 2010<br/><p>Later in 2005, the species was listed in Appendix I and II of CMS. Appendix I means that Parties are required to provide strict  protection. </p>        <p>In 2006 ICES issued this advice, which is still current:“<em>No targeted fishing for basking shark should be permitted and additional  measures should be taken to prevent bycatch of basking shark in fisheries  targeting other species. A TAC should cover all areas where basking sharks are  caught in the northeast Atlantic. This TAC should be set at zero.”</em><br/>This advice was adopted in 2007 and the zero TAC covers all areas of the NE Atlantic where basking sharks may be caught. </p>      <p>Norway ALWAYS implements ICES advice (and indeed, unless they take out a reservation, also other MEA measures – unlike many other  States). Their basking shark fishery was therefore closed in either 2006 or 2007,  I forget which but probably the latter. They are presumably still landing bycatch, because Norway prohibits discards, but fishermen are not paid  full market value for catches for which they do not have a license – only  enough to cover the cost of bringing home the catch. This means that they will  be avoiding basking sharks wherever possible. <br/></p>  <p>Because of the CMS Appendix I listing, basking shark is also an EU prohibited species: “It shall be  prohibited for Community vessels to fish for, to retain on board, to tranship and to  land the following species in all Community and non-Community waters” Every year, however, we get reports of basking sharks being caught, landed and  put on sale illegally in the EU. So, small scale bycatch and utilisation is  definitely ongoing even in areas where the species is strictly protected.</p>    <p>Elsewhere: NZ is the only place where there is still a fairly large utilised basking shark bycatch (in trawls over hoki spawning  grounds). &#160;The fins are exported under CITES license to East Asia. NZ allows finning. </p>","The Basking Shark is strictly protected under wildlife legislation within 12 nautical miles of the Isle of Man and Guernsey (United Kingdom dependent territories) and in British waters. It is protected in US Federal waters (including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea) by a National Marine Fisheries Service rule for Atlantic shark fisheries, which prohibits directed commercial fishing, landing and sale of the species and in Florida State waters. The basking shark is one of several species partially protected through New Zealand's Fisheries Act (1983). Commercial target fishing has been banned since 1991, but bycatch may be utilised. The liver and fins are landed and the fins almost certainly exported. The Basking Shark is listed on Annex II (Endangered or Threatened Species) of the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea (1976) Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean, but only Malta has legally protected the species. The Mediterranean population is also listed on Appendix I of the Bern Convention for the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats, subject to a European Commission reservation. A UK government proposal for an Appendix II listing on CITES was narrowly defeated in 2000, but was followed by an Appendix III listing in Europe later that year. Japan and Norway, the world's two main trading nations, took reservations on this listing. An Appendix II proposal, accepted by the 12th Conference of the Parties in 2002, came into effect at the end of February 2003 (www.cites.org).

Although no formal stock assessments have been undertaken for&#160;<em>C. nufar</em>, stock status indicators such as trends in catch composition and mean size, suggest that while the stocks in South Africa appear to be stable, the stock in southern Mozambique may be over-fished (Lichucha <em>et al.</em> 1999). This species is the second most important commercial linefish species in KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique, and has become increasingly important in the Eastern Cape (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;Approximately 40% or more of the fish (both sexes) caught in the fishery in Oman were immature, raising concerns about sustainability of the fishery (McIlwain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Al-Marzuqi 2011).","The first conservation actions for&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar</em>&#160;were implemented in South African legislation in 1984 and included a minimum size limit of 25 cm TL and a daily bag limit of 10 fish per person per day (pppd) for recreational anglers (regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 58 of 1973). This legislation was modified in 1992 where the minimum size limit was increased to 30 cm TL (regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 12 of 1988). The minimum size has been maintained but the daily bag limit was dropped to five fish pppd for recreational anglers in 2005 (regulations in terms of the Marine Living Resources Act No. 18 of 1998). The number of commercial line fishing vessels licensed to fish in South African waters was effectively reduced in 2006 with the allocation of long-term rights. This has undoubtedly reduced commercial line fishing effort targeting&#160;<em>C. nufar</em>&#160;in South African waters (C. Wilke Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, South Africa pers. comm.).&#160;In the rest of the&#160;distributional range of <em>C. nufar</em>, there are no known species-specific conservation measures in place.<br/><br/>In addition to traditional fisheries management, a number of large marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established along the southern African coast, which are likely to provide some protection for&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar</em>. These include the St Lucia and Maputaland Marine Reserves, Pondoland MPA, Bird Island MPA, Tsitsikamma MPA and De Hoop MPA. The recently proclaimed Ponta do Ouro Marine Protected Area (July 2009) should also provide further protection for&#160;<em>C. nufar</em>&#160;in southern Mozambique if it is effectively enforced (B. Mann pers. comm.).",Unknown,"No stock assessments have been conducted on&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar</em>. This species&#160;increased in importance in the KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) commercial line fishery between 1923 and 1985 as other larger species were fished out, and remained relatively stable between 1985–1995 (Penney&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Surveys conducted in the Southern Cape between 1931–1933 and 1987–1993 showed an increase in commercial catch composition from 6% to 21% (Griffiths 2000). A decline in contribution to overall catch composition was recorded in southern Mozambique between 1980–1990 and 1996–1997 (Lichucha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). In KwaZulu-Natal, the mean size of&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar</em>&#160;remained similar at between 30 and 32 cm FL between 1979–1981 and 2007–2010 (Garratt 1985a, B. Mann. ORI. unpublished data). However, in southern Mozambique, a decline in mean size was recorded from 395 mm FL in 1987 to 355 mm FL in 1996 (Lichucha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999), although it appears to have stabilized since then (Fennessy <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;The m:f sex ratio was slightly skewed in favour of females in Mozambique 1:1.5 (Piotrovski 1990), and was not much changed (1:1.2) in 2006-2007 (Torres 2009), KwaZulu-Natal had a ratio of 1:2.5 (Garratt 1985a) and the Eastern Cape 1:2 (Coetzee 1983) and little change has been observed in KwaZulu-Natal during 2007–2010 (1:2.2) (B. Mann Oceanographic Research Institute, unpublished data).<br/><p>The total commercial catch for&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar</em>&#160;in South Africa has remained fairly stable between 60–120 tonnes/annum from 1985–2007 but standardized CPUE over this period has shown a significant increase from 0.05 kg/man hr. to 0.15 kg/man hr.<sup></sup> (NMLS unpublished data). Recreational skiboat catches from KwaZulu-Natal remained stable at around 0.1 fish and 0.1 kg per outing between 1994–1996 and 2008–2009 (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Dunlop and Mann 2013).</p><p>Commercial data show that since 2000 fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African line-fishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels as part of the long-term rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).&#160;</p>Global FAO catch statistics show the importance of <em>C. nufar</em> across its entire distributional range and although there are large fluctuations, catches from 1987–2011 show an increasing trend. Landings from Bahrain were 16.0 tonnes, 8.5 tonnes, 10.4 tonnes for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively (E. Abdulqader pers comm. 2013). In Kuwait, landings declined from 44.6 tonnes in&#160;2000 to 12.6 tonnes in 2009 (J. Bishop pers comm. 2013) revealing a 72% decline in 10 years.&#160;Catches were not reported from Abu Dhabi (S. Hartmann pers comm. 2013) but this species is common in markets throughout the Persian Gulf.<br/><br/>Al-Marzuqi (2011) randomly sampled commercial catches for&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar&#160;</em>landed by various types of artisanal gears on a monthly basis from April 2005 to March 2007 in the Arabian Sea off Oman. The mean size at first capture was calculated to be 31.4 cm TL, which is smaller than the mean size at sexual maturity (33.7 cm TL for males and 31.9 cm TL for females), and also smaller than the size at which maximum yield per recruit occurs (40.6 cm TL). Al-Marzuqi (2011)&#160;estimated the natural, fishing and total mortality of&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar </em>to be 0.61 per year<sup></sup>, 0.68 per year and&#160;1.27 per year, respectively.&#160;The exploitation rate for 2005-2007 was estimated to be 0.52 per year<sup></sup>.&#160;Al-Marzuqi (2011)&#160;concluded that the&#160;<em>Cheimerius nufar </em>stock was marginally overfished, assuming the optimal exploitation rate is close to 0.5 per year<sup></sup> and the optimal sustainable yield is achieved when natural and fishing mortality are equal (Gulland 1971). Individuals measuring up to 29 cm TL contributed 42% of the pooled catch data, indicating that sizeable portions of immature fish are being caught before they are able to spawn, suggesting that recruitment overfishing is occurring. Al-Marzuqi (2011) concluded that this warranted implementation of a minimum legal size for capture and also suggested a reduction in effort of 17%. <br/><br/><strong>FAO RECOFI (</strong><strong>Regional Commission for Fisheries)&#160;</strong><strong>Capture Production (2004-2011)</strong><strong><br/></strong>FAO RECOFI landings do not provide a clear trend in the Persian Gulf.

However, it is of high commercial value, with a global catch of 58,076 t in 2005, and is extensively harvested throughout its range (FAO-FIGIS 2005). There have been observed declines in catch in the Eastern Pacific, but this is thought to be a consequence of higher catches during El Niño events.<br/><br/>This species is caught in various types of fishing gear, including longlines, purse seine vessels, and recreational fishing vessels (Palko <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1982). It is one of the most important species in artisanal fisheries around the world.<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean, this species is caught in association with fish attracting devices (FADS), trolling line and sport fisheries. These attracting devices such as floating bundles of bamboo reeds or cork planks are used to concentrate Dolphinfish before nets are set. The use of FADS are increasing the bycatch of this species (Nelson pers. comm. 2010). Small quantities are taken as bycatch in longline and driftnet fisheries.<br/><br/>The Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) recognizes that the lack of any institutional framework or regional body for collaborative or shared management of this resource is a concern given the increasing catches of this species in the region (CRFM 2006).","It is considered a highly migratory species under Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, there is a minimum catch size of 70 or 80 cm. In Mexico, there are area-closures for commercial fishing for this species, and a two fish sport limit. In the past, there have been conservation measures implemented by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) for no purse-seine fishing. In Ecuador, 50% of the fishing fleet, including those for tunas, use an experimental sorting grid to release juveniles, small tunas and other bycatch species. In 2005, a recreational fishing limit of five fish per fishermen per fishing day was established for this species in Puerto Rico (Rodrigues-Ferrer <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2006).<br/><br/>In the U.S., there are bag limits and size limits in the recreational fishery and size and trip limits in the commercial fishery (SAFMC 2003).<br/><br/>This species' distribution overlaps with a number of marine protected areas.",Stable,"From 1961 to 2006, the reported worldwide landings for this species from FAO have gradually increased from 17,000 metric t, to a peak of 59,000 metric t (in 2005).

Data from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC 2008) from 1976–2005 widely varies from 200 to 22,000 metric t, with a maximum of 22,000 metric t in 2001. Although there are no data on fishing effort, demand has not decreased. However, there have been many regional fishermen reporting that catches are decreasing, especially in Costa Rica and Ecuador where there are possibly localized declines in catch rates. In Peru, catch of this species is highly fluctuating; there was a catch in 2005–2006 of 2,000 and 4,000 mt by the artisanal fleet, but in 1998 21,000 t were caught after an El Niño event.<br/><br/>There is some evidence of multiple populations based on biological and morphological characteristics (Oxenford and Hunt 1986, Lessa <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008, Duarte-Neto <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008), however there is genetic connectivity between migratory groups in the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM 2006) stock assessment recognized the uncertainty about stock structure and conducted separate analyses (one that recognizes separate north and southern stocks and one combining both). The conclusion from all of the assessments was that there was no decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) indices and therefore the fishery appears sustainable at current levels. They did note the uncertainty and the need for more data from other countries within the stock area.<br/><br/>The Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) 2010 stock assessment analysed data from the Caribbean, Venezuela, Brazil and the U.S. that corroborates that this species migrates from northern Brazil to the eastern Caribbean and may also enter the southeastern Caribbean Sea. The standardized CPUE indices for the eastern Caribbean corroborates that the stock is not declining. In Brazil there is evidence of at least two stocks, one in northern Brazil (shared with the Caribbean) and one in the northeastern Brazilian coast (Lessa <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008). Although there is uncertainty in the data, the stock assessment in the northeast indicated that the stock is fully exploited (Lessa <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009).<br/><br/>This species is widespread and is very common in the Mediterranean, and catches are increasing. The average catch from 2000 to 2009 was about 8,000–10,000 t per year (FAO 2009). Off the coast of Turkey it is seasonally common. FAO landing figures are available from Tunisia, Malta and Spain. Most of the current catch figures are from Tunisia and Spain and are currently increasing. Catches from Malta have remained relatively stable since 1950.

As with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). The number of biological papers concerning the species were very few and most basic biological information was not gathered until 15–25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich <em>et al</em>. 2001). By the early&#160;1990s, the fishery in the Northwest Atlantic was no longer commercially viable and came to a halt.<br/><br/>The Canadian survey data have been claiming (in litt.) to be non-representative because they sample only the edge of the population, an unwarranted and troubling assumption. Conservation ecology has shown that trouble at the edge of a range presages trouble over the entire range (Channell and Lomolino 2000, Fraser 2000). Furthermore, deep populations of slope species are not separate from shallow ones because of ontogenetic migrations. Coryphaenoides move up and down the slope seasonally, migrating to shallower water at the end of summer and shifting deeper in winter (Dushchenko and Savvatimsky 1987,Paz and Iglesias 1994). <em>Macrourus</em> also migrate seasonally (Paz and Iglesias 1994) and follow the ‘bigger–deeper’ rule in the northwest Atlantic, with smaller juveniles generally occurring shallower than the larger adults (Savvatimsky and Gorchinsky 2001).

It is reported to be increasingly difficult to find for import into LRFFT markets, and Hong Kong-based traders have been forced to source their supply from increasingly distant localities (Anon to Y.

Their aggressive nature as dominant reef predators further accentuates their vulnerability to capture. Male and female sex ratios are heavily biased towards females, which is exacerbated by the removal of large males from the population (Murray and Cowley 2012). Although not known, is it suspected that females may be changing sex at a smaller length and a younger age as a result of overexploitation (T. Murray DIFS pers obs.).","<em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em> is currently managed with a minimum size limit of 50 cm TL and a daily bag limit of one fish per person per day for all fishery sectors (Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 2012). This species also occurs in several large no-take MPAs on the South African coast including De Hoop, Goukamma, Tsitsikamma, Sardinia Bay, Bird Island, Dwesa and the Pondoland MPAs. The Tsitsikamma National Park has&#160;been shown to provide an important refuge for juveniles and sub-adults of <em>C. nasutus </em>(Buxton and Smale 1989, Götz <em>et al</em>. 2008). As the adults probably spawn in the area between East London and St Lucia, the only MPAs which provide protection for adults of this species are the Amathole MPA, Dwesa-Cwebe MPA and the Pondoland MPA (B. Mann ORI unpublished data). MPAs are extremely important for the conservation of this species, especially due to the highly resident behaviour exhibited by juveniles and sub-adults (Murray and Cowley 2012). Data from no-take MPAs show that <em>C. nasutus </em>is significantly more abundant and of a larger mean size than in adjacent exploited areas&#160;(Maggs <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013), further supporting the importance of MPAs for the protection of this species.&#160;<br/><br/>The consideration of de-commercializing <em>C. nasutus</em>&#160;is suggested due to its low importance in the commercial fishery. Also recommended is the introduction of a slot size limit between 50 cm to 70 cm TL, to protect small resident individuals &lt;50 cm TL and large mature adults &gt;70 cm TL (Murray and Cowley 2012).",Decreasing,"<em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em>&#160;was heavily exploited throughout the 20th century which has led to a decrease in abundance and mean size (Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Although a formal stock assessment has not been undertaken for <em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em>, the trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) has declined significantly in KwaZulu-Natal (Penney <em>et al.</em> 1999) and it is estimated that the stocks have declined to ~20% of their historical values (Griffiths and Lamberth 2002). CPUE of <em>C. nasutus</em> in Tsitskamma National Park showed an increase from 1998 to 2005 CPUE (Götz <em>et al. </em>2008) while CPUE in the no-take zones of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area (MPA) was higher (0.37 fish/angler/hr) than in the adjacent exploited area (0.23 fish/angler/hr) from 2006 to 2011 (Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;Using targeted commercial effort data, there has been a significant decline in CPUE from 0.43 kg/man/hr in 1985 to 0.33 kg/man/hr in 2007 (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data).&#160;Increasing mean annual CPUE (~55%) over the last eight years (between 1998 and 2005) in Tsitsikamma National Park&#160;was recorded&#160;(James<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2012); however, this figure should be viewed with caution as the generation time for <em>C. nasutus</em>&#160;is 16 years.&#160;<br/><br/>There was little change in total commercial catch between 1930–1933 (10 tonnes) and 1986–1987 (12 tonnes) in KwaZulu-Natal (Buxton and Clarke 1989). However, the total reported commercial catch for this species has declined from a peak of 25 tonnes in 1987 to less than four tonnes in 2003–2007 (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data).&#160;<br/><br/>The trend in catch composition is also thought to have declined in KwaZulu-Natal similarly to other large, slow growing, endemic sparids (Penney <em>et al.</em> 1999). A significant decline in catch composition was recorded in the Transkei between 1984 and 1992 due to voluntary cessation of catch by commercial fishers (Hecht and Buxton 1993).&#160;<br/><br/>Male to female sex ratios in the Eastern Cape were reported to be strongly biased in favour of females (1:6) (Buxton and Clarke 1989). Mean size of <em>C. nasutus</em>&#160;has decreased, with almost 100% of the current catch weighing less than five kg and catches of trophy fish by coastal recreational anglers that were once common are now extremely rare (Murray and Cowley 2012).

The U.S. management plan employs a variety of strategies: reduction or elimination of commercial exploitation, adjustments of recreational fish-size limits and bag limits, closed seasons, and artificial spawning and stocking of fish (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2007). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has undertaken intensive efforts towards marine enhancement (stocking) of the species since 1991, which results in an average release of approximately three million fingerlings into Texas bays and estuaries. More traditional strategies for management of Spotted Seatrout have included indirect efforts, such as a ban on gill nets in Texas bays and estuaries since 1988, and targeted efforts, including daily bag and possession limits, slotted size limits, closure of the commercial fishery, and in-state regionalization of recreational harvest restrictions (Anderson and Karel 2009). In addition, there are&#160;regulations in place to close the fishery during cold weather spells (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014).&#160;North Carolina has maintained a 12-inch total length (TL) size limit for both commercial and recreational fishermen since 1989 and a recreational bag limit of 10 fish per person per day since 1994. Virginia implemented a 12-inch TL size limit for both their recreational and commercial fishing sectors in 1986 and increased the size limit to 14 inches TL in 1992 for both fishing sectors and added a 10-fish limit for any fisherman using hook and line. In 1995, Virginia established an annual quota of 51,104 lb and allowed up to 5% of the Spotted Seatrout caught (by weight) by fishermen who use pound nets or haul seines to be less than 14 inches TL (Jensen 2009).&#160;<strong>Mexico:</strong> There are no official management measures for this fishery off Mexico, but it is recommended that total catch not exceed 5,055 t and that catch should not exceed the current average annual level for each state. It is also recommended that fishing effort should not be increased, that managers should implement regulatory measures such as permitting, record catch data as species-specific, restrict the size of gill nets to 500 in length and minimum mesh size of three inches, minimum catch size of 30 cm TL, and develop a fishery management plan for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (SAGARPA 2012).",Increasing,"This species is uncommon north of the Delaware Bay, but gets increasingly abundant from the eastern seaboard of Virginia southward to Florida, and is most frequent along the Gulf of Mexico from the west coast of Florida to Texas (Blanchet <em>et al.</em> 2001). Off Texas, it exhibits continuous change with genetic isolation by distance, resulting in significant divergence between the northern and southernmost coastal sampling sites, which represents strong evidence for the existence of two subpopulations of this species in the Gulf of Mexico (Anderson and Kerel 2009).&#160;Thus, subtle differences in its life history may occur among estuaries throughout its range (Brown-Peterson and Warren 2001).&#160;<strong>United States:&#160;</strong>This species is targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries in the United States.<strong>&#160;</strong>It is listed as a gamefish in Texas and Alabama (Blanchet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). In 2007, U.S. domestic landings totalled&#160;237 t and&#160;in 2008,&#160;187 t, with an average of 164 t between 2003-2007. In 2007, the&#160;U.S. recreational fishery reported 7.5 t and&#160;in 2008,&#160;8 t, with an average of 7.5 t between 2004-2008 (National Marine Fisheries Service 2008).&#160;It&#160;is equivocally the most popular recreational marine finfish in Texas. Spotted Seatrout currently account for 36% of all landings by private boat anglers and 76% of party boat landings annually in nearshore marine waters of Texas (Anderson and Karel 2009). Stock assessments periodically conducted by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) suggest that Louisiana’s population is abundant, in good health, and not overfished. Observed and back-calculated age and growth of seatrout in Alabama showed an increase in&#160;fish length compared to previous surveys suggesting that the average fish being harvested is larger than historical catches, but that there are fewer of these larger fish present in the population as suggested by the increase in CPUE and by the decline in yield per unit of effort (Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). An average of 1,007,247 lb of Spotted Seatrout were harvested&#160;annually from both Virginia and North Carolina waters between 1991 and 2008 (Jensen 2009). The overall population trend appears to be increasing.&#160;<strong>Mexico:</strong>&#160;The seatrout fishery is considered economically valuable off Mexico. There,&#160;<em>Cynoscion nebulosus</em>,&#160;<em>C. arenarius</em>, and&#160;<em>C. nothus</em>&#160;are targeted by commercial gill net fisheries and hook and line in marine coastal areas, with&#160;<em>C. nebulosus</em>&#160;representing 60% of the total&#160;seatrout&#160;catch. The largest Mexican seatrout&#160;fishery occurs off&#160;Veracruz, which declined by 43% between 1995-2000 (five years). In the state of Tamaulipas, 86% of the catch occurs in the Laguna Madre via gill net and as bycatch of trawl and mullet fisheries. Off Campeche, the catch increased by 86% between 2003-2006, but subsequently declined by 65% in 2007-2008. Off Yucatan and Tabasco, it is caught as bycatch in the fisheries for sierra and peto and between 2000-2008, the average total catch for both states was less than 300 t per year (SAGARPA 2012).

In New Zealand, Kitefin Shark catches are generally associated with Hoki (<em>Macruronus novaezelandiae</em>), Ling (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) fisheries, and have been most frequently recorded at depths &gt;1,000 m (Blackwell 2010). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches of this species are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). It is likely that catches of this species and other shark species (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp., <em>Etmopterus </em>spp.) were historically aggregated under a generic code in both Australia and New Zealand (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Blackwell 2010). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from commercial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with high risk from commercial fishing (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>This species was previously reported in longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deepwater sharks west of the British Isles and off the Portuguese mainland (ICES 2006), but the gillnet fisheries have since closed and targeted fishing is now prohibited (ICES 2016). Kitefin Shark has also been reported from mixed deepwater trawl fisheries west of the British Isles, although catches were unknown, but presumed to be low. In the Mediterranean, the Kitefin Shark has been caught incidentally in benthic trawl targeting Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>). This species has likely been previously misidentified with other large deepwater sharks, including Portuguese Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>) and Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) (ICES 2006).

There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Southwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian, and the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>New Zealand has had a Quota Management System (QMS) in place since 1986 to provide for the sustainable management of its fisheries. The Kitefin Shark is a non-QMS species, meaning that there is no species-specific management in place for the species (MPI 2013). New Zealand has a system of Benthic Protected Areas (BPAs), however they are unlikely to provide any major refuge for this species given the spatial occurrence of the BPAs (see Black and Tilney 2015). In Australia, catches of Kitefin Shark are controlled by basket trip limits to prevent targeted fishing (Walker and Gason 2007). In Australia, a combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2016), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean<br/></strong>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for Kitefin Shark in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES 2016). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deepwater shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius </em>spp.) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deepwater fishing in 2010 (ICES 2016). In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a ban on deepwater fishing below 1,000 m depth, which may offer limited indirect refuge from fishing, however the species is regarded as open-access in this region (see Walls and Guallart 2015, 2016 for more information).",Decreasing,"Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. The Kitefin Shark is believed to be relatively common yet low in abundance, and there is likely to be little to no exchange between areas separated by the deep ocean or occurring in different ocean basins, which are considered to form distinct regional subpopulations (Compagno and Cook 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>The Kitefin Shark is considered to have a relatively large population in New Zealand (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). An indicator analysis using trawl survey data, commercial catch-effort, and observer data produced conflicting results and the status of this species is uncertain (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Adult individuals are not well monitored by trawl surveys, and indices showed no trends on Chatham Rise (1992-2010) or Sub-Antarctic (1991-1993, 2000-2009) (O’Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bagley <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), Kitefin Shark has declined by 87% over 13 years (1994-2006, standardized CPUE) (Walker and Gason 2007), which equates to a decline of &gt;99% over 3 generations (87 years).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>The subpopulation size or structure is unknown in the Northeast Atlantic, however, for the purposes of stock assessment and management, the Azores/Mid-Atlantic Ridge subpopulation is considered to be separate from the Northeast Atlantic slope subpopulation (ICES 2006, ICES 2013). The overall trend in European waters for this species seems to be of a general decrease. Targeted fisheries in the Azores peaked at 937 t in 1984 and 896 t in 1991 (ICES 2016). After 1991, reported landings declined linearly until the fishery was closed at the end of the 1990s due to stock collapse, and remains collapsed in the Azores region (ICES 2016). For the Northeast Atlantic slope subpopulation, a comparison between recent Scottish trawl surveys and United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) surveys in the 1970s showed a 94% observed decline in catch rate. However, this value must be treated with caution as it is likely that other species were mistakenly identified as this species in the initial 1970s survey (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, the Scottish trawl surveys took place at the limit of this species’ geographical range, which may explain the observed low catch rates (see Walls and Guallart 2015 for more information).<br/><br/>Preliminary assessment results from the Development of Elasmobranch Assessments (DELASS) in the Mediterranean Sea suggested the stock may be depleted to about 50% of virgin biomass. Considering a 50% decline for the 1972-2001 period, and assuming exponential decline, the annual proportional change would be 0.9764. Therefore, the reduction for the time period 1972-2059 (87 years, three generations) is 87%. When projecting this decline into the future (2017-2104, three generations), a 64% decline is estimated. In the central Mediterranean Sea, data collected between 1972-2004 from the Gruppo Nazionale Dermersali (GRUND) experimental trawl surveys reported a 15% decline. Assuming exponential decline, the annual proportional change would be 0.9949 and therefore, the reduction for the time period 1972–2059 (87 years, three generations) is 36%. When projecting this decline into the future (2017-2104, three generations), a decline of 36% is also estimated. Assuming that the proportion of the population present in the Mediterranean and in the Northeast Atlantic is roughly equal, an overall reduction of 62% is calculated for European waters for the 1972-2059 period (87 years, three generations). A reduction of 52% is projected for the 2017-2104 period (87 years, three generations) into the future (see Walls and Guallart 2016 for more information).<br/><br/>The extent of fishing outside these areas is unknown. Where intensive fishing occurs (e.g. West Africa, Taiwan), depletion levels are likely to be consistent with documented declines in core areas of abundance, and overall, the global population is inferred to have declined by at least 30%.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

For example, <em>D. pastinaca</em> made up more than 40% of the elasmobranch biomass captured in the trammel net fishery off the Balearic Islands (Morey <em>et al</em>. in review.). Small scale fisheries operating within this species' shallow water range in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic make up an important component of the European fishing fleet (Stergiou <em>et al.</em> 2006). This species was not recorded in recent (1999-2000) experimental fishing trials with trammel nets conducted within several parts of this species' known range in the Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic (Stergiou <em>et al</em>. 2006). There is a ban on trawling within 3 nm of the coast for EU countries, however there are some exceptions to this, and both legal and illegal trawling continues to occur in shallow waters in parts of the northern Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>Important grounds for reproduction (mating, parturition, nursery areas) seem to be associated with shallow sandy bottoms, which human disturbance (e.g. tourism activities on beaches) or fishing pressure (trammel and gillnets targeting cuttlefish, mullets, bass and flatfishes, and trawling) impact.","<em>D. pastinaca</em> is protected within five of the six existing Balearic Island marine reserves. Although artisanal fishing is allowed within these marine protected areas (MPAs), these stingrays must be released alive if caught. Accurate monitoring of artisanal catch in those areas where the species is very commonly taken is needed to provide information on the size of the population.",Unknown,"<strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>There is no information on the size of the population of this species within the Mediterranean, however the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) from 1994-1999 revealed a low frequency of occurrence for <em>D. pastinaca</em>. It appeared in 49 hauls, which was only 0.5% of the total number of hauls, but these surveys only sampled depths from 50-800 m and this species is more common in shallow waters &lt;50 m depth. Comparative trawl surveys conducted in 1948 (Hvar) and 1998 (MEDITS) in the Adriatic Sea (both up to 400 m depth) suggest that the abundance of <em>D. pastinaca</em> may have decreased during this period. The frequency of occurrence (frequency log transformed data) of <em>D. pastinaca</em> on the shelf according to the 1948 survey was ~0.5, whereas frequency of occurrence on the shelf in the 1998 survey was &lt;0.1 (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al. </em>2001). <br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic the common stingray is clearly less abundant than in the Mediterranean. <em>D. pastinaca</em> has reportedly disappeared from the Bay of Biscay (Quero1998), as observed for other demersal elasmobranch species. The average catch rate for this species caught during the quarter 1 IBTS in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat is 0.0006 (number per hour, 1977-2004) (ICES 2005b).

It has taken in targeted fisheries where/when abundant, and as a bycatch elsewhere within its range. Accurate species-specific landings data are not available, though species-specific data from Iceland indicate declining landings of this species. Though French data appear more stable, these landings include landings from fisheries operating towards the edge of the continental shelf, where the population now appears to be concentrated. Given that this species is likely to be taken in trawl and gillnet fisheries that target high-value telesosts (e.g., megrim, anglerfish and hake), it is unlikely that fishing effort will decrease. Common skate are targeted by recreational fisheries (e.g., off Scotland), most anglers release captured individuals.  <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong> <br/>The situation appears similar in the Mediterranean, where <em>D. batis</em> is probably captured as part of the bycatch of multispecies trawl fisheries. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), more recently effort has increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987). Since then half of the fishing effort has been displaced to targeting small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croation, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic et al. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles of this species makes it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other rajids (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean is approximately 20 mm. Considering the large size at maturity (around 130 cm) this means that the exploitation of juveniles is likely to be high. Additionally <em>D. batis</em> has been found to have undergone declines and disappearance from other shelf seas, notably the Irish and North Sea (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000).","It is recommended that suitable non-trawling areas are defined to protect both adults and deposited eggs as these are both susceptible to capture by trawling gear.  <br/> <br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>:  <br/>Though there are no species-specific management measures for this species, there is a TAC for skates and rays in the North Sea and adjacent waters, and they may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries (e.g. mesh size regulations, effort reduction). <em>Diptutus batis</em> has been identified by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Study Group on Elasmobranch Fish as one which """"requires information on either fisheries statistics, biology or status of exploitation"""" or in the case of <em>D. batis</em>, all three (Anonymous 1995). Demographic information indicates that population recovery might be achieved by allowing increasing juvenile survival (Walker and Hislop 1998). <em>Dipturus batis</em> was proposed for strict protection under the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act in 2001; a decision is still (2006) awaited from government. <em>D. batis</em> is also a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species in the UK, and was listed on the OSPAR Priority List of Threatened and Endangered Species. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>: <br/>For the conservation of chondrichthyans within the Mediterranean region, the FAO SAC Subcommittee on the Environment and Ecosystem recommended that all fishing states implement a Mediterranean Action Plan for the Management and Conservation of chondrichthyans, in line with IPOA sharks (International Plan of Action on the management and conservation of chondrichthyans). <br/> <br/>The MEDLEM project was adopted at the last SAC meeting (FAO, Rome 2005) for data collection within the Mediterranean basin on large elasmobranches. The Bern Convention encourages research programs aimed at the assessment of the conservation status of chondrichthyans in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Italy a national action plan (PAN-SHARKS) was co-ordinated by ICCRAM (Central Institute for Marine Research) within the guidelines of the Bern Convention and FAO IPOA-Sharks (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2002, Vacchi and Notarbartolo 2000). The Barcelona Convention proposed this species for urgent legal protection under its Mediterranean Action Plan.<br/><br/>A new European requirement is that common skates, when caught, should be returned to the sea - applies only to the North Sea.",Decreasing,"North-east Atlantic: Common skate, as the name implies, was historically one of the most abundant skates and rays in the North-east Atlantic. It was widely distributed in the seas surrounding the British Isles, though catch rates of this species in this area declined during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. By the 1970s common skate was considered extirpated from the Irish Sea (Brander 1981), and they have also disappeared from the English Channel and the southern and central North Sea (Walker 1999, Rogers and Ellis 2000). Though individual specimens are reported occasionally from these areas (e.g., Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005), common skate are now only regularly observed off northern and north-western Scotland, Celtic Sea and along the edge of the continental shelf (&gt;150 m depth).  <br/> <br/>A time series of comparative trawl surveys in the Gulf of Lions between 1957-1960 indicate that <em>D. batis</em> was historically present in both shelf and slope trawl surveys. It was captured in 10% of hauls (n=27) in shelf surveys (coast-150 m depth) and in approximately 17% of hauls (n=37) in slope surveys (150-800 m) (Aldebert 1997). In contrast, comparable surveys carried out from 1966-1995 in the Gulf of Lions (totalling 1,295 hauls) did not record this species (Aldebert 1997). In the Adriatic Sea, the """"Hvar"""" 1948 trawl surveys (based on 138 valid hauls taken in the spring-summer of 1948) revealed <em>D. batis</em> present in 3.2% of hauls. In a comparable survey conducted in the spring-summer of 1998 (127 valid hauls) (MEDITS) it was not recaptured, suggesting <em>D. batis</em> may now be absent from this area (Jukic-Peladic 2001). The MEDITS survey began in 1994 while another study of the Adriatic Sea had begun in 1985 (GRUND), with each project carrying out one survey per year. A single individual was captured in the first GRUND survey of 1985 and since then no specimens have appeared in the Adriatic in either of these surveys (Marano <em>et al</em>. in press). It is now regarded as locally extinct in the Adriatic Sea (Tinti <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although these surveys are exhaustive, it should be noted that the MEDITS net is thought to have a low sampling efficiency of truly benthic species (Jukic-Peladic 2001). Along the Algerian coast from 1996-1997, regular systematic surveys of elasmobranchs present in markets have been undertaken. Although eight species of skate have been recorded, <em>D. batis</em> has not been reported (Hemida 1998). Tunisian fisheries use prawn trawl and larger """"French"""" trawls, which frequently capture skates and demersal sharks. While this species has been documented from Tunisian waters in the early part of the 20th century, it has not been recorded since 1971 and it is now presumed absent from this area (Bradaï 2000). <br/> <br/>The former range of this skate included much of the west, north and eastern shelf and slope habitat of the Mediterranean.

There are historical records from Rockall and the Norwegian Deep, but its current status is uncertain (ICES 2007). In the Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Surveys of the north Norwegian Coast, mean catch was 0.5 individuals per square kilometre between 1992 and 2005 (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). The status of the population west and southwest of England and Ireland is also uncertain (ICES 2012). There are however suspected declines in areas of the shelf margin that are heavily fished. Despite a lack of species-specific population information, it is possible to infer from the statuses of similar large-bodied skate species and suspicion of trends that the population is likely decreasing, especially because it is larger than its congeners and likely to have a low intrinsic rate of population increase. Considering this and the low catch levels in surveys and fisheries, Norwegian Skate is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three generation period).</p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

The large body size (150 cm), and presumably slow growth and later maturation and likely low intrinsic rate of population increase of this species render it especially vulnerable to exploitation such as trawling and at risk of local extinction (Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002).<strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>There are no specific data available on threats, however it is inferred that, similar to other large-bodied skates, this species may be retained as bycatch in demersal trawl and longline fisheries, particularly in deeper waters. Although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets. This species is caught and landed from offshore fisheries as reported by the United Kingdom, but data are unreliable. These landings are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Given recent restrictions on landing other members of this genus, recent data indicating increasing catches of this skate are questionable due to possible reporting of other species as Longnosed Skate (<em>Dipturus oxyrinchus</em>; ICES 2013). </p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This skate<em> </em>is captured as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries targeting Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>) or Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and by offshore bottom longlines. Over the last 50 years, trawl effort has increased numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was historically exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries composed of 27 small, low-powered boats with a total of 2,700 horse power (hp), between 1974 and 1987 effort has increased to a total of 19,940 hp. In particular, fishing effort targeting small pelagic fish has increased (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), the main intergovernmental decision-making body on fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea, has made the decision to refrain from expanding deepwater fishing operations beyond the limit of 1,000 m. However this species occurs mostly from 200-500 m, thus deepwater fisheries development within the depth range of this species remains a cause for concern.</p>","<p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa) and North Sea (ICES sub-area IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years.

Between the late 1960s and 2002 United Kingdom groundfish surveys occasionally reported this species in the northern North Sea and Celtic Sea at depths of 111−159 m. Catch rates over this time period were very low ranging between 0.01 and 0.11 individuals captured per hour of trawling (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Surveys of the northern Norwegian Coast, 54 individuals were reported in 1994, and only two individuals were reported in 2005 (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). Along the northern coast of Norway from 1992−2005, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2008) caught a mean of 7.7 individuals per square kilometre. The catches in this study were relatively high, indicating that although the species is somewhat rare, local aggregations may occur. In and around the Bay of Biscay catches showed large fluctuations, ranging from zero tonnes in 1999, to 16 tonnes in 2002, and decreasing again to zero tonnes in 2010 (ICES 2012). Although information is limited, the sensitive life history characteristics and available data suggest that this subpopulation is declining in Northeast Atlantic waters. </p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>In the Mediterranean, the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) preformed 6,336 tows between 1994 and 1999 over the entire European Mediterranean area and Morocco at a depth of 10−800 m. This species was the second most abundant skate in this survey and was recorded in 3% of hauls in this area. It was found at depths ranging from 50 to 800 m, but was caught most frequently between 200 and 500 m in the western central Mediterranean Sea and eastwards in the Aegean Sea (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001, Serena 2005, Serena <em>et al</em>. 2010). A longline survey in 2004 confirmed the presence of this species in the southeast Aegean Sea, around Rhodes between 300 and 400 m depth (Corsini-Foka 2009). <span lang=""""EN-GB"""">This species was historically present in the Gulf of Lions, northwest Mediterranean Sea, where it was captured in 10% (n=27) of hauls, occurring between 1959 and 1972 (coast to 150 m depth) and was also present in the catches of surveys performed between 1980−1984. It was subsequently absent from 628 scientific tows done in the same area in the period 1985−1995 (Aldebert 1997). Similarly, in the Adriatic Sea, historical trawl surveys from 1948 showed that this species was present in 3.2% of hauls carried out on the continental shelf, while in a comparable MEDITS survey in 1998 reported that this species was absent from all hauls on the continental shelf (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). In the south Ligurian and north Tyrrhenian Seas this species has been found at depths ranging from 164−750 m, and was mostly concentrated on the outer margin of the slope from 300−400 m. Over this survey period, biomass has reportedly decreased while abundance remained stable. This suggests a change in population structure, with an increasing presence of juveniles in catches. Given the sensitive life history characteristics, evidence of significant population declines and apparent disappearance in some localised areas (likely due to fisheries pressure), this subpopulation is considered to be decreasing throughout the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><span lang=""""EN-GB"""">Considering the status of other<em>&#160;Dipturus&#160;</em>species in the European region,&#160;<em>D. oxyrinchus</em>&#160;is also inferred to be in decline, although to a lesser extent due to its smaller size, and it is suspected that the species has declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three-generation span).</span></p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

Over the last 150 years, the subpopulation of anchovy in the Yellow Sea has exhibited great fluctuations with periodicity of around 50 years, and the pattern of current recovery and collapse is similar to that of historical records with strong evidence of climate-driven affects (Huang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).   </p><p>Prior to the beginning of the large-scale fishery in the Yellow Sea in 1989, the subpopulation size fluctuated between 2 and 3 million tons; since the development of this fishery the Yellow Sea subpopulation has undergone a rapid decline, especially after 1996 (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2003). For example, the&#160;annual biomass in the Yellow Sea dropped from 4.1 million tons in 1993 to 180,000 tons in 2002 (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2003), and to a historic low in 2003 of only 11,000 tons, which represents a decline of 96 – 99 % over roughly a 10 year time interval (thought to represent three generation lengths for this species). In the winter of 2001 – 2002, the acoustic estimate of the anchovy stock size in the Yellow Sea was only 0.18 million tons, which represents less than 10% of its pristine level. The optimum sustainable yield was estimated at 520,000 tons between 1987 and 2002 (Zhao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Furthermore, the maximum recruitment in the Yellow Sea was about 186 billion fish, with a corresponding spawning stock biomass of about 3.2 million tons during this time period (1987 – 2002), which was close to the mean prior to 1996. The Yellow Sea stock was considered to be fully exploited according to Zhao <em>et al</em>. (2003). The annual biomass increased and remained at 250,000 – 300,000 tons during 2004 and 2005&#160;(Zhao 2006 via Wan and Bian 2012).&#160;</p>    <p>Off the south Shandong Peninsula and in the coastal waters of the East China Sea, anchovy&#160;egg size has notably decreased at known spawning grounds (Wan and Bian 2012). Additionally, the natural mortality of eggs has significantly increased since the 1980’s (Wan and Bian 2012). However, despite heavy commercial exploitation, this species remains to be one of the most common species taken in Chinese commercial purse seine fisheries (Pauly and Le Manach 2015).<br/></p>  <p>In Korean waters, the annual catch has fluctuated since the mid – 1970’s from 100,000 to 250,000 tons and coastal fisheries are in general decline due to overfishing (Hwang <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2006). Korean spawning stock biomass ranged from 67,760 to 182,570 metric tonnes in spring and more than doubled, from 154,610 to 390,010 metric tonnes in summer during the time period between 1983-1994 (Kim and Lo 2001).&#160;The biomass of this species in Asan Bay, Korea was&#160;estimated&#160;at 24.1 – 93.3 tons from July to October 2012 (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2014). The montly CPUE of the Korean anchovy drag net fishery ranged between 0 and 1,500, with a peak of 2,254 in February 1997 and CPUE of the drift gillnet fishery generally ranged between 0 and 400, with the lowest values in 2000–2006 and a peak&#160;of 1,292 in February 1995 (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;In Korean waters, long-term trends of embryonic mortality, egg production and spawning stock biomass can be explained largely by spring warming, summer cooling and decreased zooplankton in the late 1980’s (Kim and Lo 2001). <br/></p><p>The annual catches of juvenile and subadult&#160;anchovies off western Kyushu Island, Japan has fluctuated between 10,000 and 40,000 tons between the 1960s&#160;and the 2000s (Takeshige <em>et al.</em> 2015). Water temperature fluctuations caused by changes in wind stress has been shown to drive population fluctuation off Kyushu (Takeshige <em>et al</em>. 2013). Changes in larval transport success due to oceanographic fluctuations related to climate change have the potential to affect anchovy recruitment off the western coast of Japan (Takeshige&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p><p><strong><em><u>Pacific Ocean</u></em></strong></p>  <p>Throughout the 1960’s to mid - 1970’s, total annual catch fluctuated between 100,000 to 250,000 tons in Japanese Pacific waters.

The recent 2016-2020 Amateur and Commercial Fisheries Circular adopted a prohibition on fishing, collecting, transferring and selling&#160;<em>E. aeneus </em>and also&#160;<em>E. marginatus</em>&#160;in Turkey.<br/><br/>In Tunisia, all grouper individuals below 35 cm standard length must be released and spearfishing for&#160;groupers is totally prohibited (Journal officiel de la République Tunisienne 1994, 1995).

Species-specific landings for&#160;<em>E. aeneus </em>are reported to<em>&#160;</em>FAO by some&#160;countries, and other countries also exploit this species, but only report it in mixed grouper catches. Some of the data sets present conflicting evidence which is difficult to interpret. Global FAO landings ranged between ca. 1,000 and 2,000 mt from 1965 to 2008, and increased steeply thereafter to <em>ca</em> 7,500 mt in 2014<span style="""""""">.&#160;</span>This may represent a genuine increase in catch, but may also reflect improved reporting in some countries, greater fishing effort or countries reporting catches made in adjacent countries (see below). For example, Sierra Leone did not report catches of this species until 2014. That first report of <em>ca </em>3,000 mt constituted 40% of the global catch.<br/><br/>Grouper species have been fished for centuries along the north-west African coast. Since the 16th century, small-scale canoe fisheries have been targeting these resources in Senegal and Mauritania. During this time period, European fishers also started fishing off the north-west African coastline (Chauveau 1989 in Thiao<em> et al</em>. 2012). At the beginning of the 20th century,&#160;<em>E. aeneus</em>&#160;was described as a target species for artisanal fishers based in Saint-Louis, which was the main fishing centre in northern Senegal. Despite the fishing effort for this species, the resource was not considered to be overexploited until the Second World War (Postel 1950 in Thiao <em>et al</em>. 2012). Following Senegal’s independence in 1960, the catch reached 3,570 mt in 1964 (Lourdelet 1996 in Thiao <em>et al.</em> 2012) and represented almost 20% of the Senegalese fish catch taken by handlines. At the end of the 20th century, the fishery underwent dramatic changes. In 1994, the development of an export market for high-quality demersal species such as groupers was enhanced by the 50% devaluation of the local currency. At present, most of these high-value species are directly exported to European and Far Eastern markets (Swartz<em> et al.</em> 2010). During this period, the development of the Senegalese small-scale fisheries was strongly supported by external aid and public subsidies, which enabled the small-scale fleet to double in size from 1985 to 2005, and it is continuing to increase (Thiao<em> et al.</em> 2012). The situation appears similar in Mauritania, where there was an eight-fold increase in the numbers of artisanal fishing boats from the 1980s to <em>ca</em> 2010 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015), which is further evidenced by the increasing trend in FAO landings (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Effort probably substantially increased further since 2010. <span style="""""""">Given the data presented below, this species' global population is suspected to have declined by an average of at least 24% and likely approaching 30% over the past three generation lengths, which is estimated as 33 years.</span><br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean:&#160;</strong><em>Epinephelus aeneus</em>&#160;was apparently previously a relatively abundant species in the Mediterranean Sea, but has declined significantly in many parts.<br/><br/><strong>Greece: </strong>Previously, the catches reported by Greece to FAO made it the greatest global contributor – in fact, Greece was the only country that reported catches until 1984, when Mauritania commenced reporting (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Greece began reporting in 1958, reached a peak catch of 2,100 mt in 1968, and subsequently generally declined significantly until the early 1980s. By 1984, the catch was only 593 mt and it continued a steady decline until 2011 when a zero catch was reported.

From 2008 onwards, catches increased significantly to <em>ca </em>1,600 mt in 2014. This increase could be ascribed to increasing effort in both the artisanal and industrial fishing sectors (Labrosse </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""""""> 2010 in Meissa and Gascuel 2015). In Mauritania, the probability of catching this species declined from 60% in 1995 to 10% in the late 2000s (Meissa 2008 in Thiao </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""""""> 2012). On the adjacent Western Saharan Bank, </span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style=""""""""> accounted for 5.3% of the mean total abundance of fish during research trawl surveys in 1942, but declined to only 0.001% by 1974 (&gt; 99% decline over a 33 year period); </span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style=""""""""> was not recorded during a fisheries research cruise there in 1990 (Balguerías </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""""""> 2000).&#160;</span><em>Epinephelus aeneus</em><span style="""""""">&#160;is a flagship species in West Africa that is exploited by industrial and small-scale fisheries in Mauritania, and the stock is highly overexploited (Meissa&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style="""""""">. 2013). Subsequently, Meissa and Gascuel (2015) estimated MSY at 1,025 mt and fMSY as a very low 0.07 yr</span><sup>-1</sup><span style="""""""">, based on a <em>ca</em> 25 year time series of data up to 2010. Note that the FAO landings for 2014 (<em>ca</em> 1,600 mt) exceed this MSY by 56%, although it is not inconceivable that Mauritanian fishers also fish in adjacent countries, but report catches in Mauritania, as noted for Senegalese fishers.<br/><br/><strong style="""""""">Senegal:</strong> Of the countries in north-west Africa, Senegal reports the highest landings for this species to FAO. Senegal began to report catches to FAO in 2003, when it recorded a catch of 685 mt (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Catch increased steadily to 2,142 mt in 2014, and the annual average catch from 2003 to 2014 was 1,383 mt. Although these relatively recent catch data could be indicative of a developing fishery, other longer-term indicators (see below) indicate that this species has long been overfished in Senegalese waters. For example, the Senegalese small-scale fishery landed 3,570 mt in 1964 (Lourdelet 1996 in Thiao <em style="""""""">et al</em>. 2012) and total catch of&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;across small-scale and industrial fisheries was 1,851 mt in 1991 (Gascuel and Ménar 1997). Overall Senegalese landings of this species reported by Ndiaye <em style="""""""">et al</em>. (2013) were ca. 2,200 mt in 1981, peaked at ca. 4,900 mt in 1983 and declined to ca. 850 mt in 2008, which constitutes a 79% decline over a 26 year period. As reported earlier, FAO landings contrast with these data (see Supplementary Material). Contributing to this discrepancy may be Senegalese fishers buying licenses to fish&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Guinea and Sierra Leone where the stock is more abundant&#160;(Thiao <em style="""""""">et al</em>. 2012), but presumably reporting their catches in Senegal, thereby reflecting an apparent increase in FAO landings for Senegal. Catch data collected from three artisanal fishing sites in northern Senegal also recorded a precipitous decline of about 95% from a peak of ca. 1,300 mt in 1975 to 64 mt in 2006&#160;(i.e., over a 32 year period) (Thiao <em style="""""""">et al</em>. 2012). The catch per unit effort (CPUE; kg/trip) also declined by 95% over this period. CPUE in research trawls also declined by about 20% from 1987 to 2004 (an 18 year period).&#160;FAO working groups (FAO 2006, 2012 in Thiao <em style="""""""">et al.</em> 2012) recommended a moratorium on catches of&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Senegal and Mauritania due to the expected extirpation of the species otherwise. Gascuel and Ménar (1997) classified&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Senegal as an overexploited species based on&#160;fishing effort in 1991, this being 2.7 times greater than the fMSY and MSY was estimated as ca. 3,000 mt a year, which was exceeded by the artisanal fishery alone between 1984 and 1986 (Gascuel and Ménar 1997). As a result, catch declined and reached a low at 1,135 mt in 1998 (Martial&#160;<em style="""""""">et al</em>. 2002). A range of stock assessment approaches showed a decline in biomass in Senegal of 80 to 90% from 1971 to 1999 (over 29 years) due to excessive fishing effort (Laurens&#160;<em style="""""""">et al</em>. 2002, 2003). According to Froese (2004), the Senegalese stock of<em style="""""""">&#160;E. aeneus</em>&#160;was overfished based on a decline in the percentage of mature&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;individuals in the catch from about 80% in the early 1990s to about 38% in 1999. During the same period, percentages of&#160;<em style="""""""">E.&#160; aeneus</em>&#160;individuals at optimal length and of ‘mega-spawners’ (i.e. fish &gt;100 cm TL) had decreased from about 35% to less than 20%. Ndiaye <em style="""""""">et al.</em> (2013) repeated the approach of Froese <em style="""""""">et al. </em>(2004) and reiterated that the stock was overexploited; however, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the age and growth parameters used to determine optimal length. A 40% decline of the mean length of individuals in the catch has also occurred: from 68 cm in 1974 to 42 cm in 2010. The optimal length of capture to maintain fishery sustainability was 96 cm, but only 0.03% of captured individuals&#160;were of this length, and most of the catch consisted of juveniles. Thiao<em style=""""""""> et al</em>. (2012) suggested that the collapse of the&#160;<em style="""""""">E. aeneus</em> fishery in Senegal is linked to the booming small-scale fishery sector benefiting from increasing foreign demand in a globalised market, and a favourable economic context for fishers who benefit from public subsidies to purchase fishing gear, etc.</span></p>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

In the Port Survey conducted by the AFCD with fishermen in 1996/1997, the estimated annual catch of this species&#160;by weight was 1 metric ton in Hong Kong waters (AFCD 1998). This species was considered commonly taken in the past, but has become rarer over time (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). A Hong Kong market survey conducted from 2004 to 2006 recorded 13 wild caught individuals of this species, 52% of which were immature and it ranked 13<sup>th</sup>&#160;by number amongst other grouper species (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). The size of fish declined by 19 to 41% over about 40 years, which may indicate overfishing. A survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets recorded 99 individuals of this species, which represented about 0.4% of all groupers surveyed (including farmed and wild caught individuals) in terms of number, and 63% were found to be immature (Lam 2013). There is no long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Hong Kong. An underwater survey conducted in coral areas and rocky reefs and adjacent areas in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016 recorded this species only once (n=187 surveys; Shea and Ho 2016). However, this species occurs in areas that were not sufficiently surveyed such as silty sand bottoms in deeper waters, and its absence in shallow reef surveys should be interpreted with caution.</p><strong>Japan:&#160;</strong>Landings of this species in the&#160;Yaeyama Islands of Japan was 280, 53 and 56 kg respectively for 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the number of individuals landed during these years were 624, 135 and 103 (Ohta 2008). The stock of this species is very likely to be declining (K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). From 2008 to 2013, landings of this species at Fukue Fish Market, Goto Island increased from about 500 kg in 2008, peaked at 2,000 kg in 2011 and then was stable from 1,300 – 1,400 kg in 2012 and 2013 (Nakagawa 2014). The average weight of individuals of this species landed at the Goto Island port was around 1 kg per fish from 2008 to 2010, then weight per fish slightly increased in 2011 and 2012. During this time period, local fishing effort and number of fishermen did not increase (Nakagawa 2014, K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). There is a lack of long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Japan.<p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Persian Gulf, Abu Dhabi and Oman:&#160;</strong>Aggregate FAO RECOFI landings of this species<em>&#160;</em>in the Persian Gulf increased from 306 in 2000 to 473 tonnes in 2011. It&#160;was consistently recorded in the Abu Dhabi fishery from 2001-2012. In 2005, it was separated&#160; from the aggregated serranid landings (1.2 mt in the fishery). Landings&#160;declined from 1.2 tonnes in 2005 to 0.4 tonnes in 2012, which represents about a 67% decline over eight years. This species has typically&#160;been only a very minor component of the serranid catch in the UAE. It is occasionally found in markets (i.e., not directly targeted) elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. This species may be extensively fished in Oman and the Arabian Sea by the line fishery and trawling, and there are concerns for impacts on the population from high fishing pressure (J. McIlwain unpublished data).&#160;</p><p><strong>India: </strong>Fisheries surveys conducted from 2010 to 2011 in Kerala, India reported that this was an ‘abundant’ species captured in the seamount fishery off the west coast, and the size range of the fish was 22 to 32 cm (Bineesh <em>et al.</em> 2014). A survey conducted from 2009 - 2011 in fish landing centres of Visakhapatnam reported that the common size of this species in the commercial catches was 19 to 21 cm total length (n = 81) (Kandula<em> et al.</em> 2015).</p><p><strong>Indonesia:</strong> This species is caught in the deep water demersal multi-species fisheries in eastern Indonesia, and from 2014 to 2016 at least 90% of the individuals (n = 13,112) were mature. This fishery does not target immature size classes of this species (Mous and Pet 2016). Mega-spawners accounted for about 9% of the catch by number for this species. Although this fishery is not known to be causing overfishing of this species, there is substantial risk for overfishing due to the unsustainable harvest of mega spawners (Mous and Pet 2016). In Buton (eastern Indonesia), underwater surveys conducted in 2006 and 2007 recorded 4 and 8 individuals of this species per hectare, respectively. In Kalmas in 2010, the density of this species was 2 fish per hectare and in Sibolga (western Indonesia) surveys reported 4.4 fish per hectare in 2008 (S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016). It was not recorded in other surveys conducted from 2004 to 2013 in many other localities, but this may be due to the lack of survey effort in deeper and silty sand bottoms.&#160;</p><p><strong>East Africa: </strong>A market survey conducted in 2007 at three beaches in southern Kenya where there is high artisanal fishing effort reported that this species comprised less than 1% of all grouper catches (in terms of number of fish) (Agembe<em> et al.</em> 2010). This species represents 0.5 to 1% of the total catch in the small-scale industrial and commercial line and trap fisheries of Mozambique (Maputo unpublished data). This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> most commonly landed serranid in commercial fisheries of Djibouti (Darar 1994). Underwater surveys conducted from 2010 to 2015 at 52 sites across Tanzania, Mozambique and Djibouti recorded only a single sighting of this species (M. Samoilys unpublished data 2016).</p><p><strong>Maldives:</strong> The grouper fishery in the Maldives in 2010 reported a shift in size distribution for some of the most commonly exploited species to smaller size classes, and a significant decrease in mean lengths for the most common species in comparison to a similar study conducted around the year 2005 (Sattar and Adams 2005, Sattar<em> et al.</em> 2011). Many landed grouper individuals in the Maldives fishery are immature (Sattar <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the length of this species in the export trade during 2003 to 2004 was about 31.8 cm total length (n=23; Sattar and Adams 2005).</p><p><strong>Australia:</strong> This species is captured in the commercial Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery of Western Australia where it represents about 7% of total finfish catch (in terms of number of fish) and a wide size range of this species was recorded (Newman <em>et al</em>. 2001). About 220 – 240 kg of this species were landed in 2014 and 2015 in the commercial Queensland line fishery (State of Queensland 2013). Reef Life Survey data from 2010 to 2015 yielded only a single record of this species from Australia (Edgar and Stuart-Smith 2014). It was not recorded during underwater surveys conducted in the Great Barrier Reef (Pears 2005).&#160;&#160;</p><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> During a survey conducted in the Solomon Islands Honiara fish market in 2015 and 2016, this species comprised about 5% of all groupers in terms of number of fish and about 98% of these individuals were mature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources).&#160;<p><strong>New Caledonia: </strong>This is one of the most common grouper species caught by fisheries on soft bottoms in New Caledonia (8% of grouper catch).

It is likely declining where trawl fisheries are highly active.</p><p><strong>Hong Kong:&#160;</strong>In the 1960s, the common size of this species in the Hong Kong market was about 35 cm total length (Chan 1968). In the Port Survey conducted by the AFCD with fishermen in 1996/1997, the estimated annual catch of this species&#160;by weight was 1 metric ton in Hong Kong waters (AFCD 1998). This species was considered commonly taken in the past, but has become rarer over time (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). A Hong Kong market survey conducted from 2004 to 2006 recorded 13 wild caught individuals of this species, 52% of which were immature and it ranked 13<sup>th</sup>&#160;by number amongst other grouper species (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). The size of fish declined by 19 to 41% over about 40 years, which may indicate overfishing. A survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets recorded 99 individuals of this species, which represented about 0.4% of all groupers surveyed (including farmed and wild caught individuals) in terms of number, and 63% were found to be immature (Lam 2013). There is no long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Hong Kong. An underwater survey conducted in coral areas and rocky reefs and adjacent areas in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016 recorded this species only once (n=187 surveys; Shea and Ho 2016). However, this species occurs in areas that were not sufficiently surveyed such as silty sand bottoms in deeper waters, and its absence in shallow reef surveys should be interpreted with caution.</p><strong>Japan:&#160;</strong>Landings of this species in the&#160;Yaeyama Islands of Japan was 280, 53 and 56 kg respectively for 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the number of individuals landed during these years were 624, 135 and 103 (Ohta 2008). The stock of this species is very likely to be declining (K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). From 2008 to 2013, landings of this species at Fukue Fish Market, Goto Island increased from about 500 kg in 2008, peaked at 2,000 kg in 2011 and then was stable from 1,300 – 1,400 kg in 2012 and 2013 (Nakagawa 2014). The average weight of individuals of this species landed at the Goto Island port was around 1 kg per fish from 2008 to 2010, then weight per fish slightly increased in 2011 and 2012. During this time period, local fishing effort and number of fishermen did not increase (Nakagawa 2014, K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). There is a lack of long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Japan.<p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Persian Gulf, Abu Dhabi and Oman:&#160;</strong>Aggregate FAO RECOFI landings of this species<em>&#160;</em>in the Persian Gulf increased from 306 in 2000 to 473 tonnes in 2011. It&#160;was consistently recorded in the Abu Dhabi fishery from 2001-2012. In 2005, it was separated&#160; from the aggregated serranid landings (1.2 mt in the fishery). Landings&#160;declined from 1.2 tonnes in 2005 to 0.4 tonnes in 2012, which represents about a 67% decline over eight years. This species has typically&#160;been only a very minor component of the serranid catch in the UAE. It is occasionally found in markets (i.e., not directly targeted) elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. This species may be extensively fished in Oman and the Arabian Sea by the line fishery and trawling, and there are concerns for impacts on the population from high fishing pressure (J. McIlwain unpublished data).&#160;</p><p><strong>India: </strong>Fisheries surveys conducted from 2010 to 2011 in Kerala, India reported that this was an ‘abundant’ species captured in the seamount fishery off the west coast, and the size range of the fish was 22 to 32 cm (Bineesh <em>et al.</em> 2014). A survey conducted from 2009 - 2011 in fish landing centres of Visakhapatnam reported that the common size of this species in the commercial catches was 19 to 21 cm total length (n = 81) (Kandula<em> et al.</em> 2015).</p><p><strong>Indonesia:</strong> This species is caught in the deep water demersal multi-species fisheries in eastern Indonesia, and from 2014 to 2016 at least 90% of the individuals (n = 13,112) were mature. This fishery does not target immature size classes of this species (Mous and Pet 2016). Mega-spawners accounted for about 9% of the catch by number for this species. Although this fishery is not known to be causing overfishing of this species, there is substantial risk for overfishing due to the unsustainable harvest of mega spawners (Mous and Pet 2016). In Buton (eastern Indonesia), underwater surveys conducted in 2006 and 2007 recorded 4 and 8 individuals of this species per hectare, respectively. In Kalmas in 2010, the density of this species was 2 fish per hectare and in Sibolga (western Indonesia) surveys reported 4.4 fish per hectare in 2008 (S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016). It was not recorded in other surveys conducted from 2004 to 2013 in many other localities, but this may be due to the lack of survey effort in deeper and silty sand bottoms.&#160;</p><p><strong>East Africa: </strong>A market survey conducted in 2007 at three beaches in southern Kenya where there is high artisanal fishing effort reported that this species comprised less than 1% of all grouper catches (in terms of number of fish) (Agembe<em> et al.</em> 2010). This species represents 0.5 to 1% of the total catch in the small-scale industrial and commercial line and trap fisheries of Mozambique (Maputo unpublished data). This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> most commonly landed serranid in commercial fisheries of Djibouti (Darar 1994). Underwater surveys conducted from 2010 to 2015 at 52 sites across Tanzania, Mozambique and Djibouti recorded only a single sighting of this species (M. Samoilys unpublished data 2016).</p><p><strong>Maldives:</strong> The grouper fishery in the Maldives in 2010 reported a shift in size distribution for some of the most commonly exploited species to smaller size classes, and a significant decrease in mean lengths for the most common species in comparison to a similar study conducted around the year 2005 (Sattar and Adams 2005, Sattar<em> et al.</em> 2011). Many landed grouper individuals in the Maldives fishery are immature (Sattar <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the length of this species in the export trade during 2003 to 2004 was about 31.8 cm total length (n=23; Sattar and Adams 2005).</p><p><strong>Australia:</strong> This species is captured in the commercial Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery of Western Australia where it represents about 7% of total finfish catch (in terms of number of fish) and a wide size range of this species was recorded (Newman <em>et al</em>. 2001). About 220 – 240 kg of this species were landed in 2014 and 2015 in the commercial Queensland line fishery (State of Queensland 2013). Reef Life Survey data from 2010 to 2015 yielded only a single record of this species from Australia (Edgar and Stuart-Smith 2014). It was not recorded during underwater surveys conducted in the Great Barrier Reef (Pears 2005).&#160;&#160;</p><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> During a survey conducted in the Solomon Islands Honiara fish market in 2015 and 2016, this species comprised about 5% of all groupers in terms of number of fish and about 98% of these individuals were mature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources).&#160;<p><strong>New Caledonia: </strong>This is one of the most common grouper species caught by fisheries on soft bottoms in New Caledonia (8% of grouper catch). It is not frequently captured in the handline fishery, but is a major component of serranid longline catch in New Caledonia (Kulbicki <em>et al</em>. 2000).&#160;&#160;</p><p><strong>Taiwan:</strong> During 10-15 years of underwater observation in a very limited locality in Taiwan, this species was regarded as “occasional” (K-T.

Degradation of estuaries (juvenile habitat) and coral reefs (adult habitat) may also impact this species (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2002).","Conservation measures directed to the Persian Gulf population have included reduction in fishing effort, modification of gear selectivity and the introduction of juvenile escape panels in the demersal trap fishery.&#160;In Qatar, fishery regulations include restricted mesh size, number of vessels, trip frequency and licensing (A. Al-Kuwary pers. comm. 2013). However, these measures were found to be ineffective (Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2011). Suggested alternative measures include a moratorium on the use of traps in the offshore demersal fishery of Abu Dhabi&#160;(Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2011). There are no restrictions on fishing effort for this species in Oman&#160;(McIlwain <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species is under total protection in New South Wales, Australia (Public Consultation Document 2002) and there is a strict length limit enforced in Queensland, Australia (Fishing Industry Organization and Marketing Amendment Regulation 1993). This species was&#160;released on Hong Kong artificial reefs in Yan Chau Tong and Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in 2001 as a part of restocking trial (Cheung 2001), it is not known if this improved recovery.",Decreasing,"According to reconstructed catch data compiled by Sea Around Us, global catch of this species (including data reported to FAO) has been declining since 1987 by 40%&#160;from 15 tonnes to 9 tonnes in 2014, which is a period of 27 years. Landings are primarily from Hong Kong, China and Iran and secondarily&#160;from Saudi Arabia (Pauly and Zeller 2015).&#160;It is inferred that fishing effort has not declined, and has likely increased. Though declining in parts of its range, population decline on a global level is not known to come close to qualifying for the thresholds under Criterion A.<br/><strong><br/>Western Indian Ocean: </strong>This&#160;species is commonly captured in the grouper fishery off southern Kenya (total catch was about 40 kg in 2007) (Agembe <em>et al.</em> 2010). It is one of the most abundant groupers recorded in underwater surveys off western India (Sluka and Lazarus 2010). In the central eastern coast of India, <em>Epinephelus coioides</em> comprised 22% of catch in 2009 to 2011 (Kandula<em> et al.</em> 2015).&#160;During a trawl survey conducted in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea in 2003/2004, this species comprised 0.2 to 0.5% of the total biomass (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). This species is overfished in Oman and the Persian Gulf (Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2005, Grandcourt <em>et al.</em> 2009,&#160;Grandcourt <em>et al</em>. 2011, McIlwain&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). <em>Epinephelus coioides </em>is found at higher densities on artificial reefs than on natural habitats in the UAE, which may amplify exploitation (Feary<em> et al</em>. 2011). In a 2013 regional Red List assessment of its population in the Persian Gulf, landings from Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran and Saudi Arabia declined by an average of 51% over three generation lengths (27 years). From 1979-2012, landings of <em>E. coioides</em> in Kuwait declined from 318.5 mt in 1979 to 119.8 mt in 2012, representing a 62% decline over 33 years (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013).&#160;From 2004-2012, landings of <em>E. coioides</em> in Bahrain declined from 572.3 mt in 2004 to 161.6 mt in 2012, representing a 72% decline over eight years (E. Abdulqader pers. comm. 2013). From 2005-2011, FAO landings of E. coioides reported by Qatar declined from 2,093 mt in 2005 to 1,292 mt in 2011, representing a 38% decline over seven years (FAO 2013). Over the last 10 years (2002-2012), aggregate serranid landings declined by 36% (1233 to 788 mt) (Annual Fisheries Statistics Report for Abu Dhabi Emirate 2002, 2013). A fisheries resource survey conducted in 2002 in UAE waters recorded a 13% decline in abundance for&#160;<em>E. coioides</em>&#160;(Shallard 2003). From 1999-2012, FAO landings of <em>E. coioides</em> reported by Iran declined by 24% from 4,460 mt in 1999 to 3,399 mt in 2012 (FAO 2013).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Pacific Ocean:&#160;</strong>In Indonesia, the fishery for this species is not considered overfished, catch is not populated with juveniles and overfishing risk is relatively low (Mous and Pet 2016). Underwater surveys conducted on Hong Kong reefs from 2014 to 2016 described this species as 'uncommon', with a sighting frequency of 2.7 (sightings per trip), although this does not necessarily reflect its population status in Hong Kong (Shea and Ho 2016). A&#160;market survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006 observed 689 wild-caught individuals of this species, of which 93% were caught in Hong Kong waters and all were considered to be immature (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). A&#160;survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets, observed 4,046 individuals of&#160;<em>E. coioides,</em>&#160;which comprised about 15.7% of all groupers&#160;by number,&#160;and 99% were immature (included samples from mariculture, Lam 2013). This species&#160;is common in Taiwan (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016), and 11 and 19 tonnes were landed in Taiwan in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Taiwan Fishery Year Book 2014-2015).&#160;A spawning aggregation of 1,000 to 5,000 individuals of&#160;<em>Epinephelus coioides&#160;</em>has been reported from Papua New Guinea. Fishers reported that they landed between 200 and 500 fish in a night 30 to 40 years ago, whereas by 2003, they landed between 50 and 100 fish in a night, a decline of 50% (Hamilton 2003).

It was also not reported from the North Kenya Banks in the late 1950s (Morgans 1964). It has been observed during shallow (less than 30 m depth) underwater surveys in southern Mozambique coral reefs between Ponta do Ouro and Inhaca (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 1996, Pereira 2003). Underwater shallow&#160;surveys conducted in the St. Lucia and Maputaland Marine Reserves of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 1987 and 1992 recorded five individuals of this species out of 43 groupers (Chater <em>et al</em>. 1995). It is considered to be abundant (~27 individuals per 1,000 m² of reef) in the Seychelles (Pears 2005). Only a few individuals of this species were recorded in linefish catches in the east African region by the mid 1970s (Nzioka 1977). It was relatively commonly recorded (8% of all groupers) in commercial line catches from southern Mozambique in the mid-1990s (Dengo and David 1993, van der Elst <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Subsequently (to 2005), its contribution to grouper catches fluctuated between 0 and 4% by number (D. Gove pers. comm.).

A fish survey conducted from 1974 to 1977 on reefs between Mafia Island (Tanzania) and the North Kenya Banks captured five specimens of this species out of 130 total groupers (Nzioka 1977).&#160;It comprised less than 2 and 3% of grouper catches by artisanal fishers from the south coast of Kenya from February to July 2007 and December 2013 to July 2014, respectively and&#160;higher proportions of juveniles compared to adults were observed&#160;<span lang=""""EN-IN"""">(Agembe <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ogongo <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Shallow water underwater surveys from Isle Glorieuses, Madagascar conducted in 2015 recorded 2.78 fish per hectare, and in northern Mozambique in 2011, 1.1 fish per hectare were recorded (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016).&#160;At Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, it was the sixth&#160;most frequently captured species in the subsistence fishery by weight (5% of the catch) from 1995 to 2007 (Pistorius and Taylor 2009).

In 2004, Puerto Rico’s Department of Natural Resources passed a new fisheries regulation to prohibit the take of <em>Epinephelus guttatus</em> during its spawning season. The U.S. federal government (NOAA) has designated a ban on the take of <em>Epinephelus guttatus</em>. However, the enforcement and implementation of the new regulations has been low (M.T. Schärer pers. comm.). Spawning aggregations of <em>Epinephelus guttatus</em> are protected in St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands), and there are signs that the species is recovering in this area, including an increase in average size of fishes (Nemeth 2005). There are also permanent closures off Bermuda and seasonal closures off St. Croix (Nemeth 2012). Two spawning aggregation sites off Bermuda have been closed to fishing from May-August every year since the 1970s. Though delayed, there is some evidence that this closure has been somewhat successful in protecting adults (Luckhurst and Trott 2008).&#160;&#160;Improvements in fishery data collection are recommended for the U.S. Caribbean to improve uncertainty associated with stock assessments as well as further research on certain biological parameters (SEDAR35 2014).<br/><br/>The <em>E. guttatus</em>, <em>Mycteroperca tigris</em> and <em>M. venenosa</em> aggregations at “Bajos del Norte” on the Campeche Bank of Mexico are protected by their relative geographic isolation and a conventional fisheries management measure for groupers in general (i.e., seasonal fishery closure 15 February to 15 March until 2016; 1 February to 31 March from 2017; SAGARPA 2003, 2016, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). This, however, provides only partial protection for <em>E. guttatus</em> considering its spawning season occurs between January and April (Caballero-Arango 2013, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2014). Regulation of the commercial grouper fishery in Mexico currently consists of five main elements: (1) limits on commercial finfish fishery permits; (2) seasonal fishery closure for all grouper species; (3) a minimum size limit of 30.9 cm total length (2009-2010) and 36.6 cm since 2010 only for red grouper; (4) use of circle hook numbered 10/0-12/0 for inshore fleet and 14/0 or larger circle hooks for the offshore fleet (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b); and (5) a quota awarded to the Cuban fishing vessels operating on the Campeche Bank (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). The effectiveness of these protective measures are not understood. It has been recommended to reduce the current fishing effort on groupers to levels prevailing in the 1980s (estimated at 320 vessels carrying an average of six trips a year for each fishing unit and with duration of 15 days per trip). Creation of a year-round no-take marine protected area at “Bajos del Norte"""" would probably be the most effective measure for managing grouper species that spawn at this reef (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).",Unknown,"This is one of the most common species of <em>Epinephelus</em> in the West Indies. It is not highly valued in the market as compared to other groupers and there are no known significant declines on a global-level (L. Rocha pers. comm. 2014). It is taken off Cuba, but not particularly valued and no species-specific statistics are available there (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>U.S. Caribbean:</strong> The Caribbean Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP-C), a fisheries-independent sampling program on the western insular platform of Puerto Rico, indicate average catch per unit effort (CPUE) has declined, as well as the average body lengths of both males and females. These declines occurred in both protected and unprotected areas prior to the enactment of seasonal fishing closures. A small increase in annual average CPUE occurred in both areas soon after the enactment of closures, but was followed by continual low values. Initially, there were no significant differences in annual average lengths, by sex, prior to and following the enactment of seasonal closures, but significant increases were observed during 2004 to 2006 (A. Marshak MS thesis). The most recent stock assessment conducted for this species in the U.S. Caribbean indicates several key data gaps, but concluded that the stock has, on average, a 32.5%–60% risk of experiencing overfishing and therefore is being exploited unsustainably (SEDAR35 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Southern Gulf of Mexico:</strong>&#160;Species-specific landings are not available from Mexico and all groupers are lumped in the official landings data as “Mero”&#160;(Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2011, SAGARPA 2013).&#160;At least 18 grouper species are exploited commercially by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets through a sequential fishing operation pattern: the Mexican inshore (artisanal or small-scale fishery) vessels target juveniles, and the Mexican and Cuban offshore vessels mainly capture adults. The fishery occurs mainly in the southern Gulf of Mexico, on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76 %) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). Between 1996 and 2008, average commercial landings in Yucatan had declined by about 51% as compared to the 1970’s. The Cuban fleet recorded a 66% decline in average CPUE over a period of 18 years (1984-2002) (average values were 6 kg per 100 hooks for the period from 1984-1990 and then declined to 2 kg per 100 hook for the period from 1999-2002). The Mexican fishery is considered to be in an overall state of decline. Over the past 28 years (1984 to 2012), the average CPUE (kg per fishing trip) of the offshore Mexican fleet declined by 51%. Average CPUE was 2,800 kg/fishing trip between 1984 and 1990, 1,800 kg/fishing trip between 1991 and 1995, and 1,400 kg/fishing trip between 1996 and 2008 (SAGARPA 2012). Since 2006, some species-specific landings statistics have been collected, but are presented as local common names, which causes uncertainty (SAGARPA/CONAPESCA 2016 http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad Accessed October 2016). <br/><br/>Notwithstanding, some official landings data for <em>Epinephelus guttatus</em> together with <em>E. adscensionis</em> were 28 and 14 metric tons in 2014 and 2015, respectively (SAGARPA, Delegación Federal en Yucatán, Subdelegación de Pesca, Departamento de Administración de Pesquerías pers. comm. 2016). This species is exploited by the Mexican offshore fleet on coral reef areas of the Campeche Bank, including “Arrecife Alacranes” and “Bajos del Norte” (Tuz-Sulub 2008). Since 1997, professional ﬁshers from Yucatan have harvested grouper at “Bajos del Norte” from February to May each year to specifically fish spawning aggregations. Fishers obtained high landings of <em>E. guttatus</em>, <em>Mycteroperca venenosa</em> and <em>M. tigris</em> in 2001, with a single vessel harvesting 2,435 kg of grouper at this site in just 10 days (average 244 kg/day) (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2003) and maximun daily commercial catches of <em>E. guttatus </em>in February 2001 at “Bajos del Norte” were between 22 and 56 kg (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Mangrove coverage, which is responsible for biomass production of this species, has been reduced by at least a third since the 1970s to 1990s, and much more of the habitat is unsuitable as juvenile habitat because of anthropogenic impacts (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Valiela <em>et al</em>. 2001, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Multiple cohorts were affected by a cold temperature event in 2010, which caused a die-off of juveniles in the Everglades National Park, Florida (Hallac <em>et al</em>. 2010). Juveniles have also been impacted by past severe red tide events on the West Florida Shelf (SEDAR47 2016). A study conducted in Florida reported that mean mercury concentrations in individuals of this species were within the range known to cause direct health effects in fish after long-term exposure, and concluded this could cause stress on their populations (Adams and Sonne 2013, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Another study conducted off Belize also found elevated levels of mercury (Evers <em>et al</em>. 2009). Ongoing research on the impacts from high mercury concentrations indicate that older males in particular suffer liver damage and/or mortality, and that egg viability is reduced (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Another potential threat to the recovering population is inbreeding, and related genetics studies are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/></p>","There has been a complete moratorium on harvest of these species in continental U.S. waters since 1990 and in U.S. Caribbean waters since 1993, and it is clear that the implementation of this management measure was the key factor in the increase in individuals in the southeastern U.S. seen at the current time (Porch <em>et al</em>. 2003, SEDAR47 2016). The SEDAR47 stock assessment analysis shows that the population can decline by nearly 85% in just 1.9 generations in the absence of this management effort, and therefore, it is highly recommended that this moratorium remain in place (Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2012, Frias-Torres 2012, Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Conservation measures for this species off Mexico are insufficient and improvement in regional and international management, including a formal stock assessment, are needed (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009). Under direction of the IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency), this species has been fully protected in Brazil since 2002. This reduced fishing effort, but did not eliminate it due to insufficient enforcement against poaching (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b, B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018). The inter-Ministry ordinance No.13 of 2015 granted protection for this species until 2023 in Brazilian waters. Spawning aggregation sites should be a priority for conservation. This species has been recorded in several marine protected areas, including the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hickerson <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Parque Nacional Guanahacabibes in western Cuba (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Research is currently underway on adult and juvenile habitat preference, size, age, movement, aggregation location and behaviour and feeding ecology in U.S. waters. Further research is needed on the genetics and age structure of the offshore portion of the U.S. population to improve stock assessment models (SEDAR47 2016).",Decreasing,"This species has undergone a severe population decline throughout its entire range and is now rare where it was formerly abundant due to overfishing (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In most areas, there has been no indication of population recovery. Unfortunately, there are very few historical data sets that are available to gauge population sizes prior to widespread exploitation (beginning around the 1950s) to serve as a reference for the degree of decline in population sizes. As of the writing of this assessment, the southeastern U.S. is the only area in which an appreciable increase in the population of this species has occurred, this following a moratorium on catch in 1990 (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). This is also the only area where reasonably accurate historical landings and effort data are available, and the only area in which a quantitative stock assessment analysis has been completed (SEDAR 47 2016). Even though official historical quantitative records are poor to non-existent, it is clear from well-documented anecdotal observations that a rapid decline occurred over at least the past 50 years as fishing intensity increased and as mangroves declined over the 1970s to 1990s. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the early 1950s, which covers a time period of about three generation lengths (at least 64.5 years).<br/><br/>There is empirical evidence that the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic populations should be treated as one unit. Craig <em>et al</em>. (2009) found that genetic differentiation occurs between Belize and southwest Florida, and Brazil and Florida. Population genetics studies are currently underway in Florida, and preliminary results indicate that inbreeding is likely due to the moderately low genetically effective population size, which is further evidence for a population crash (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>United States:&#160; </strong>Based on historical catches by state, the highest abundance of this species in U.S. waters is in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and its historical centre of abundance has been in the Ten Thousand Islands of southwest Florida (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). This species has been targeted by fishers in U.S. waters since colonial times (late 1800s) and fishing mortality was excessively exceeded from 1963-1989, which resulted in severe population declines. In the 1950s and 1960s, this species was common off southern Florida, but by the 1970s and 1980s, the population had been severely depleted to the point that fishers were forced to travel offshore and target spawning aggregations to sustain catch (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Overall, the steepest period of decline in this species is estimated to have begun in the 1950s and extended at least through the early 1990s, which is a 41-year period (1.9 generations), and during this time, the population declined by nearly 84%. This rapid decline in numbers reflects not only a trend in greater harvest, but also intrinsic biological characteristics which make this species particularly vulnerable to over harvest. These characteristics are primarily reflected in their aggregate spawning behaviour (in which several hundred individuals gather in a predicable place and time), which can lead to hyperstability of populations (SEDAR47 2016). Adults were generally uncommon to rare in the mid 1990s, but the population has been recovering upon the implementation of a fishing moratorium in 1990 and continues to the present. The juvenile abundance index in southwest Florida substantially declined during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been steadily increasing since the 1990 moratorium until at least 2006 (Cass-Calay and Schmidt 2009). Abundance increased in the mid-1990s directly offshore of the high-quality mangrove nursery of the Ten Thousand Islands and then continued to expand north and south, eventually increasing off Florida’s central east coast as well until at least 2007 (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, SEDAR47 2016). Abundance declined after 2007 until 2011, and despite some upward trends, abundance remains low overall. A severe red tide event on the West Florida shelf in 2005 and cold-kills in 2008 and 2010 in South Florida estuaries are thought to be the drivers of these declines (SEDAR47 2016). Porch <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated there was a 90-100% chance for a 50% population recovery by 2006-2011. Fisher compliance to the moratorium, however, was found to be lower than 90%, which led to a prediction of less than a 40% chance that the population would recover to the 50% population recovery benchmark by 2020 (Porch <em>et al</em>. 2006). Under the moratorium, the estimated relative biomass increased from 0.22 to 0.72 from 1993-2003 and it was categorized as overfished in south Florida in SEDAR6 (2004), but the authors could not determine if overfishing was still occurring due to the lack of data. Considering its high vulnerability to overfishing, a continuation of the moratorium was recommended until further research could determine a complete rebuilding to the target biomass (SEDAR6 2004). From 1993 to 2010 (17 years), relative abundance increased by about five fold, but its overfished status in the South Atlantic could not be determined due to the lack of natural mortality parameters and reliable estimates of moratorium effectiveness (SEDAR 2011). The most recent spawning stock biomass models suggest it is no longer overfished nor experiencing overfishing (SEDAR47 2016); however, the population continues to be skewed towards younger fish 26 years after closure, and will require more time to rebuild the older age classes (Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Stock assessments conducted by the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) have been repeatedly rejected under peer review because of poor historical records and the resulting inability to determine population recovery in terms of size and geographical extent. Despite the large degree of uncertainty in the historical data upon which the most recent stock assessment, SEDAR47 (2016), is based, it is the only available stock assessment with which historical trends in abundance may be gauged. And, while we acknowledge the large degree of uncertainty in this analysis, we posit that the overall trends in the magnitudes of changes are likely to be real even though the absolute values may change with improved historical input data. It is also important to note that the values presented below are based on computer simulations (models) and do not represent direct counts of individuals. We caution that the absolute numbers cited below be interpreted with caution. It should also be noted that this analysis is only for the population of this species in the southeastern U.S. SEDAR 47 (2016) utilized a stock assessment model to hind cast various metrics of abundance to the year 1950. That analysis showed that the average number of individuals among model iterations in 1950 was 513,072 in the southeast U.S.&#160; This number remained relatively constant until about 1975, when it declined from a mean of 378,164 individuals in 1975 to a mean of 82,900 individuals in 1991, which represents about an 80% decline over 16 years. After 1991, the number of individuals increased to a high of 1,186,100 in 2006, but declined thereafter until 2011 with a mean number of fish of 298,500, which is a 75% decline over five years.&#160; In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), there was a mean of 345,700 individuals. From 1950 to the historical low (1991), there was an absolute population reduction of about 84% (over 41 years). From the historical low in 1991 to 2014 there has been a population increase of about 86%. Over the entire period modelled from 1950 to 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis) there has been an absolute population reduction of about 33%. The increases in the numbers of individuals were largely driven by an increase in age-0 fish (which cannot reproduce). During the period 1950-2014, age-0 Atlantic goliath grouper represented 50-85% of the entire population. In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), the percentage of age-0 fish was 69%.&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Cuba, Mexico and Belize:&#160; </strong>No fishery assessments have been conducted for this species in the southern Gulf of Mexico and Mexican fishery statistics do not include fishing effort (CONAPESCA). In Mexico, exploitation is unregulated and its population status is poorly known. Some fishery dependent data indicate declining catch trends of this species (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fisher interviews and records from fishing cooperatives off the northern Yucatan indicate that catch has severely declined over about the past 35 years (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In Cuba, lobster fishermen frequently captured this grouper species (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Although national statistics are not available, population declines observed in Cuba are at least similar to those observed in Mexico. In Belize, it is considered overfished and undergoing overfishing (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>Due to a fishing moratorium for this species in place in Brazil since 2002, catch declined by 70% after 2002, but an average of 393 tons per year were poached between 2003-2011 (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b). For example, in the state of Maranhão, fishermen have illegally caught large numbers of adults in spawning aggregations (M.O. Freitas pers. comm. 2016). In northern Brazil and on the Amazonian coast, catches are reported to continue and poachers have targeted aggregations and the species is openly captured and traded in local markets (B. Bentes pers. comm. 2016). In Santa Catarina, Brazil, at least two aggregation sites were mapped and aggregation size ranged from two to 60 individuals (Gerhardinger <em>et al</em>. 2009), but subsequent dives showed that these aggregations were depleted or had moved (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species is relatively rare in offshore oceanic islands (Bertoncini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishers on the Abrolhos Bank noted that the abundance of this species has declined by more than 40% and that poaching continues to occur (Zapelini <em>et al</em>. 2017). Spawning populations in northern Brazil are the main source for the population of juveniles in French Guiana (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a and b). During Reef Check underwater surveys conducted in Brazil from 2002-2017 in 12 localities and 114 reef sites, individuals of this species were observed only three times, all inside fully protected areas (Reef Check Brazil unpub. data); however, this species can occur recurrently in some very predictable places, particularly shipwrecks. Poaching occurs at these sites despite the protected status of this species in Brazil (B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>West Africa: </strong>This species is common in shallow waters along mangrove swamps and river mouths near the rivers of Zaire, Ogoué, Cameroon and tributaries as well as near offshore oil platforms of Cabinda and Gabon (Port Gentil), where it is captured by local artisanal fisheries. It is apparently rare in the Gulf of Guinea islands; one specimen was speared in Sao Tomé in 2009 and two juveniles were observed in 2015 (J. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). Two specimens were taken via spear in Benguela, southern Angola in 2011 (J. de Sousa pers. comm. 2016). One <em>ca</em> 250 kg specimen was observed in a fish market in Libreville, Gabon in 2015 (J.

There may be some localised declines, but none on a global-scale. Underwater surveys conducted on the Great Barrier Reef indicate very low natural abundances of this species with evidence of restriction to northern reefs (Pears 2005). Experimental linefishing conducted on the Great Barrier Reef recorded 178 individuals of this species with total lengths ranging from 22.6-44.8 cm and ages ranging from 1-7 years (Mapleston <em>et al</em>. 2009). During experimental fishing conducted in New Caledonia, this species comprised 24% by number and 16% by weight of all serranids caught. Catches in 1987 were approximately twice as high as in 2000, and average weight changed from 1.1 to 0.9 kg per fish for the same levels of fishing effort suggesting possible decline (M. Kulbicki unpublished data 2016).&#160;The Philippines government reported that catches of this species from 1999-2016 varied annually from 0-50 metric tonnes until 2013, increased sharply in 2014 and 2015 to 1,739 and 2,345 mt respectively, and then declined to 713 mt in 2016 (Santos<em> et al</em>. 2017). In Pohnpei, Micronesia, 35 individuals of this species were observed in the coral reef fishery over a five-month survey period, for a total of 1.9% of the total serranid catch and a size range of 18.5 to 34.5 cm total length (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). In 2015, a total of 5 individuals were observed over a 12-month survey period, which represented 0.2% of the total Pohnpei epinephelid catch (K. Rhodes and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016). In Chuuk, Micronesia, this species was not among the top 50 fish species observed during a 12-month market survey in 2014, the mean total length among individuals was 34.6 cm and it represented 0.2% of all individuals landed (J.

No fish were observed in Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap or Rongelap of the Marshall Islands (Houk unpublished data 2016). In a market survey conducted in Honiara in the Solomon Islands, this species comprised 5% of the total groupers, individuals ranged in size from 21-48 cm total length and it represented the 7th most abundant grouper in fish sales (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data 2016).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, fishing is banned for a period of 45 days from April 15 to May 31 annually for mechanised trawlers, gill netters and purse seiners (<span style="""""""">Kirubasankar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</span>While many marine parks have been introduced in areas within the range of&#160;<em>E. malabaricus</em>&#160;(e.g., Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippines) most of these are considered to be 'paper parks' and are poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced. However, some marine parks in East Africa that this species occurs in are relatively well-enforced (Mafia in Tanzania and Maindi in Kenya; Gaspare and Bryceson 2013). It also occurs in Djibouti’s marine parks (Samoilys <em>et al</em>. 2014). Larval rearing of this species has been achieved in Thailand (Tookwinas 1989) and hatchery production occurs in Taiwan.",Decreasing,"This species can be relatively common in parts of its range, including Australia (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Sheaves 1995). Information on population abundance and fishery catches of<em> Epinephelus malabaricus </em>is limited largely due to historical confusion/misidentification with <em>E. coioides</em> and <em>E. tauvina</em>. Recent fishery-independent estimates of population densities found zero or low densities of this species on shallow coral reefs (shallower than 30 m) (http://reeflifesurvey.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/search accessed October 2014; M. Samoilys unpublished data 2009-2015). It&#160;is targeted during all life history stages throughout its range, including for the live reef food fish trade, and is probably overfished in some countries, sometimes markedly. Although, fishing pressure on&#160;<em>E. malabaricus</em>&#160;has reduced the global population, quantitative data on changes in population size are not available to estimate percent decline. This species is not regularly monitored either by visual census or in any fisheries. Furthermore, even anecdotal information is missing from large areas of its range, including Indonesia, the Red Sea and New Guinea. In addition, historical confusion with other grouper species introduces significant uncertainty when discerning population trends.<br/><strong><br/>New Caledonia:&#160;</strong>Historically,&#160;<em>E. malabaricus</em> was common in New Caledonia, but has become rare in shallow waters&#160;over the past 20 years. Some individuals remain in deeper waters (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2004). It is considered overexploited in the southern lagoon along most of the west coast of New Caledonia. On the east coast and in the Loyalty Islands, the stock is probably moderately exploited, but abundance has declined from levels 30 to 40 years ago judging from photographs taken at that time. The average size observed at Noumea market is around 5-10 kg and the maximum size around 25 kg. The species is regularly present in catches, especially during the spawning season, but never in large quantities (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2004)&#160;<br/><strong style=""""""""><br/>Malaysia:</strong>&#160;This species is commonly sold in Malaysian markets, but usually in small quantities. &#160;<br/><strong><br/>India:<em>&#160;</em></strong>This&#160;is a common species along the west coast of India and in the Gulf of Mannar. It is also one of the dominant species in the Andaman Islands, and may be exploited there in large quantities for the live fish trade (J. Charles pers. comm. 2004).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>East Africa:</strong>&#160;Historical aggregate grouper landings data (1978-2001) from Kenya declined by about 80% since peaking in the 1980s. In southern Kenya, 67&#160;individuals of this species were observed in local fisheries during a six-month survey. Together with <em>E. coioides</em> and <em>E. fuscoguttatus, E. malabaricus&#160;</em>comprised the bulk of the grouper catch in terms of biomass (Agembe <em>et al</em>. 2010). Some grouper populations are protected within Kenyan marine parks, but even in those areas, densities are very low. During a two year trapping project within two Malindi and Watamu marine parks in Kenya, only one specimen of <em>E. malabaricus</em> (&gt;60 cm) was taken (B. Kaunda-Arara pers. comm. 2003).<br/><strong><br/>Asia-western Pacific:</strong> The species was not recorded during a rapid biodiversity assessment of the Calamianes Islands in Palawan Province, Philippines (Werner and Allen 2000) or in the Raja Ampat Islands in West Papua, Indonesia (McKenna<em> et al</em>. 2002), or in the Togean and Banggai Islands in Sulawesi, Indonesia (Allen and McKenna 2001). The species was also not recorded in surveys conducted from 2007 to 2015 in the Coral Triangle, the main Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, Mariana, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and Pacific Remote Islands (NOAA 2016). Only two individual sightings are reported from the Pacific Islands over a 10 year time span (2001-2011) - from Vanuatu and Kiribati (Pacific Regional Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Development Programme). Juveniles of&#160;<em>E. malabaricus</em>&#160;are wild-caught and used to supply mariculture in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and China. It is&#160;is the most commonly taken species after&#160;<em>E. coioides</em>&#160;in many areas (Sadovy 2000, Gaspare and Bryceson 2013).&#160;In the Philippines, <em>E. coioides</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. malabaricus</em>&#160;comprise most of the catch of juveniles for grow-out in the Philippines and anecdotal declines of up to 50% have been reported for some areas due to overfishing and possibly habitat degradation (Sadovy 2000).<br/><strong style=""""""""><br/>Western Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden:</strong> Underwater surveys conducted in the western Indian Ocean from 2009 to 2015 did not record this species in Tanzania, Comoros and northeastern Madagascar (Samoilys and Randriamanantsoa 2011, M. Samoilys unpublished data). It was only observed at two sites in 2011 in northern Mozambique&#160;(average density 0.31 fish/ha; Samoilys<em> et al</em>. 2011). It was not observed in Chagos, which suggests this species may not occur there. It has been observed&#160;on the remote fully protected area of Isle Glorieuses (France) with densities ranging from zero to 0.93 fish per hectare (0-8.06 kg/ha). Densities were higher in Djibouti, ranging from zero to 2.78 fish per ha (0.0-13.16 kg/ha). In the Andaman Islands, this species comprised 21.6% (1.296 tonnes) of annual grouper landings in 2010-2011, catch per unit effort varied from 4 to 16.5 kg per h<sup>-1 </sup>and the population was considered overexploited<sup>&#160;</sup>(<span style="""""""">Kirubasankar <em>et al</em>. 2013).</span><br/><p><strong>Hong Kong:&#160;</strong>It is reportedly rare in Hong Kong&#160;(Sadovy and Cornish 2000) and recent surveys did not locate any individuals there as well (Shao and Ho 2016).&#160;A&#160;wet market survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006 recorded only 26 wild-caught individuals (To 2009). A survey conducted in Hong Kong wet markets and restaurants in 2012/2013 recorded 185 wild-caught and farmed individuals, and 100% of these were suspected to be immature base on the estimated maturity size (Lam 2013).

The slow growth rate, protogynous hermaphroditism and spawning aggregation behaviour of this species causes it to be particularly susceptible to rapid population decline upon high fishing pressure (Fennessy 1998, 2000).","<strong>Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean: </strong>A spearfishing ban has been imposed on this species in France, Monaco, the Azores and Madeira. In France, the first moratorium from 1993 to 1998 prohibited only spearfishing, but in 2003, it was extended to include angling by both artisanal and professional fishermen, and is now expected to remain until at least 2023. Increasing abundance in French marine protected areas (MPAs) is believed to be related to several factors: increased numbers of MPAs and connectivity between them, spearfishing bans and warming of the Mediterranean Sea (Harmelin 2013). The removal of legal protections for this species (i.e., a resumption of spearfishing and linefishing) would impact the re-established juvenile populations that now exist in this area (Bodilis <em>et al</em>. 2003). Banning spearfishing while allowing linefishing may offer little protection for this and other similar large grouper species (J.P. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). At the international level, <em>E. marginatus</em> is listed in Annex III of the Barcelona Convention (species for which their exploitation is regulated). This species is also recorded in Annexe III of the Bern Convention, but only for the Mediterranean Sea. A number of MPAs have also been established which protect both the populations and habitats of this species throughout various parts of the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesia (EUNIS 2014). Renones <em>et al</em>. (2010) recommends implementing a “slot” size limit for this species in Spain to allow only capture of individuals between 50 and 80 cm total length (i.e., only females) and to establish MPAs with no-take zones.<br/><strong>Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: </strong>In Brazil, there is a minimum catch size of 47 cm for all fisheries that capture this species, and it occurs in many MPAs. Monitoring of artisanal/recreational fisheries landings are insufficient in Brazil.<br/><br/><strong>Western Indian Ocean:</strong> In South Africa, there is a bag limit of one fish per person per day and a minimum size limit of 60 cm total length for all fisheries. It occurs in several MPAs in South Africa and southern Mozambique.<br/><br/><strong>West Africa:</strong> There are no species-specific conservation measures in the West African region. <br/><br/>Tidepools are an important habitat for juveniles, and thus, protections within MPA networks are needed (Barreiros <em>et al</em>. 2004, Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further genetic research on the populations of this species is needed (Schunter <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in at least four main separate/disjunct populations with minimal gene flow between them: the northeastern Atlantic/Mediterranean, the southeastern Atlantic/West Africa, the southwestern Indian Ocean and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Schunter <em>et al</em>. 2011). Population information is available from some areas in its range from fishery landings and underwater surveys. In shallower areas, underwater surveying is probably the most effective method for population estimation. In the Mediterranean Sea, which is one of the main centres of its global population, landings data indicate a serious and continuing decline. Some populations of this species (e.g., in Macaronesia and probably also parts of southern Brazil) have apparently experienced a lesser impact from fishing pressure than the Mediterranean and southern Europe population; however, these areas are likely to represent a relatively small proportion of the overall global population in comparison to the Mediterranean and northwestern Africa. There is a lack of adequate catch/population information from some of its relatively wide distribution (e.g., South Africa, and parts of Brazil) which could be used to determine any significant population trends in these areas. Populations around some of the Macaronesian islands, and particularly the Azores (J.P. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016), although relatively small, are considered to be relatively healthy compared with those found in mainland southern European and Mediterranean waters, but may also be declining (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>According to total global landings reported to FAO from 1950 to the mid 2010s (mostly only reported at the species level by European/Mediterranean countries), catch was about 200 metric tons in 1950 and gradually increased over the subsequent 23 years to a peak of about 6,000 metric tons in 1973 (FishStatJ database accessed 2015; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Between 1975 and 1983, annual landings declined to between 1,000 to 2,000 metric tons and then rapidly increased to peak at about 8,000 metric tons in 1992. These landings were primarily attributed to developing fisheries in the Mediterranean. From 1993 onwards, global landings declined very rapidly to about 1,000 metric tons in 2015 and are expected to have since remained at that level. This represents an estimated decline of 86% over the past 24 years (1992-2016), a period equivalent to about one generation length, and these declines are considered to be ongoing. In addition, there was an estimated decline of ~88% over 10 years for southern Europe and the Mediterranean prior to 2001; and an even greater decline of ~94% over 20 years using decadal averages for southern Europe for the period between 1984 and 2013. Quantitative data are lacking in two out of the four subpopulations, but based on knowledge that grouper fisheries are in significant decline in those areas, it is suspected that at least a 30-50% decline in its global-level population has occurred over the past generation length (about 34 years; 1982-2016) and is expected to continue into the future over the next two generation lengths, which is a time period that extends to about 2083 (a total of 101 years).&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean:</strong> According to archaeological sites in Spain, Tunisia, Corsica, Cyprus, Sicily and Italy, this species was very abundant in the coastal systems between the 35th and 40th parallels, accounting for 30-80% of the examined bony remains until the end of the Mesolithic and during the Neolithic eras (Desse and Desse-Berset 1999). A survey of ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman mosaics and paintings reported the depiction of large groupers being caught near the water’s surface by fishermen using poles or harpoons from boats, techniques that would yield no grouper catch today, which also supports the implication that abundance in coastal waters was high in the distant past (Guidetti and Micheli 2011). In the northern Mediterranean, this species had not been reproductively active until relatively recently, probably due to an unbalanced sex-ratio (i.e., lack of males) caused by fishing (Bodilis <em>et al</em>. 2003), but has also traditionally been more naturally abundant in the southern Mediterranean (Echwikhi <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, increases in density, recruitment and reproductive populations/spawning aggregations have been observed in the northwestern Mediterranean since about 2010 (P. Lenfant and P. Francour pers. comm. 2016) due to an effective fishing moratorium along the French Mediterranean coast. Individuals reported from the northeastern Atlantic at latitudes above ~45 degrees north are generally large and probably correspond to non-reproducing vagrants. In most of Spain and Italy, this species is relatively abundant only in marine protected areas (MPAs) where fishing is totally prohibited (La Mesa and Vacchi 1999, Guidetti <em>et al</em>. 2014, Barreiros 2015). There is evidence from underwater surveys that this species may be undergoing recovery in several Mediterranean marine protected areas where fishing is either restricted or banned (Vacchi <em>et al</em>. 1998, Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al</em>. 2008, Di Franco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Villamor and Becerro 2012, Garcia-Rubies <em>et al</em>. 2013, Harmelin 2013, Guidetti <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>According to FAO landings statistics, catch declined over the past 20 years in Italy by 98%, in Turkey by 78%, in Libya by 83%, in Greece by 28%, in Spain by 59% and in Portugal by 93% (FishStatJ database accessed 2015; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). The targeted fishery for this species in Turkey and Libya developed and peaked later than the fishery in Italy. The fishery in Spain and Portugal peaked earlier than that in Italy. A decline has also more recently been observed in Tunisia and southern Spain due to overfishing (Francour and Gratiot 2007); but no further details are available. Catches from Libya currently comprise the majority of catch from the Mediterranean Sea, and around half of the current global catch of this species. In the Azores archipelago, total catch fluctuated between 1978 and 2015, and generally declined after 2000 (Santos 2015).<br/><br/><strong>West Africa: </strong>According to FAO landings statistics, Mauritania has reported four years of catch (from 2010 to 2013), that averaged ~66 metric tons per year. From 2003 to 2013, annual catch reported by Senegal averaged ~123 metric tons, with no particular trend over time. Anecdotal reports claim large commercial catches of this species were exported from southern Angola in the 1990s (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2016). In 2008, it comprised 2% of the artisanal catch in Namibe and Tombua, Angola (W. Potts pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Western Indian Ocean: </strong>This species is occasionally caught south to Knysna, South Africa (34°S, 23°E), whereafter (i.e., westwards of there) it is increasingly uncommon. Specimens found to the south of 31°S are reproductively inactive, and much smaller than those found further to the north along the east coast of southern Africa (Fennessy 2006). Based on data collected in 1995-1997, spawning biomass per recruit in the South African population had been reduced to ~30% of pristine levels and was considered overexploited (Fennessy 2000). The only South African long-term data of grouper catch trends is from largely unverified compulsory commercial catch records submitted by fishing boat skippers to the national fisheries department, and these data were aggregated for all serranids (though four species, including this one, were predominant in the catch). A substantial reduction in commercial fishing effort occurred in 2003 as well as a reduction in the recreational bag limit and an increase in the minimum size limit to 60 cm. Evidence of any recovery following these interventions was, however, not clear. Two surveys conducted in the 1990s and 2000s recorded that this species comprised a relatively low portion of catches in eastern South Africa. In southern Mozambique between 2002 and 2014, catch per unit effort of this species in the semi-industrial line fishery varied between 0.5 and 8.7 kg/boat/per day, with no significant trends over time. However, this fishery had commenced in earnest by the mid-1990s, and the contribution of this species to the overall catch is suspected to have declined since then (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2016; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: </strong>This species is targeted by artisanal fisheries and spearfishers from Espírito Santo to Santa Catarina in southern Brazil (Andrade <em>et al</em>. 2003). It is also targeted by bottom long-line fleets from Espirito Santo to Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. No useful longer-term catch data are available from this subpopulation, except for the Santa Catarina region of southern Brazil (Figures 4 and 5 in the Supplementary Information). The Santa Catarina fishery developed over a ten-year period from around 1988 (~25 metric tons) to 1998 (~75 metric tons), after which catches declined by almost 99% to only ~1 metric tons by 2012 (about 15 years). The fishery in Sao Paulo is smaller, and showed no particular trend, fluctuating between ~5 and ~25 metric tons between 1998 and 2015. In Rio de Janeiro, catch data are only available from 2011 to 2014, during which total annual catch declined from ~9.2 to ~6.4 metric tons. Catch per unit effort also declined from about 75 to 20 kg/trip between 2011 and 2014.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Secondary threats, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, might include hypoxia and red tides, seismic pulses from air guns used in the oil and gas industry, deployment of pipelines on the seabed and warming waters due to climate change (Coleman and Koenig 2010, Arreguín-Sánchez <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). &#160;</p>","In U.S. waters, this species is managed under federal government regulations and regular science-based stock assessments. In the Gulf of Mexico recreational sector, there is a size limit, daily bag limit and annual catch limit for this and other grouper species. In the Gulf of Mexico commercial sector, there is a size limit, a total catch quota, closed season in certain areas, a daily bag limit (SEDAR42 2015). In the South Atlantic, there are also size limits, trip limits and harvest of shallow-water groupers (includes gag, black grouper, red grouper, scamp, red hind, rock hind, coney, graysby, yellowfin grouper, yellowmouth grouper, and tiger grouper) is prohibited from January 1 to April 30 in Atlantic and Monroe County (Florida) waters for the commercial sector. In the recreational sector, there is a size limit, a daily bag limit for all grouper species (SEDAR 53 2017). Management measures implemented in 2004, as part of the Gulf of Mexico red grouper rebuilding plan, include a reduced aggregate commercial shallow-water grouper quota, a red grouper quota within the aggregate quota, and a recreational bag limit of two red grouper within the five fish aggregate grouper bag limit (GMFMC 2008). The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council established 16 marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Gulf of Mexico, such as the Flower Garden Banks, the Florida Middle Grounds, the Madison-Swanson and the Steamboat Lumps Marine Reserves and the Tortugas Ecological reserve (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2004). Conservation of older individuals within some of these areas has been documented (Coleman et al. 2011, Koenig and Coleman 2013).<br/><br/>In Mexico, the grouper fishery is seasonally closed from February 15 to March 15 each year (since 2003) in Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure was extended two months from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Other regulations include limiting commercial fishing permits, gear requirements (hook size), and a minimum size limit (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). Cuban vessels fishing in Mexican waters operate under a set quota (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). Species-specific grouper landings data would improve estimates of its population status and further reductions in fishing effort to levels prevailing in the 1980s (SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). Fishing by commercial fleets in the Campeche Bank during spawning season should be reduced as well as the capture of juveniles (Caballero-Arango 2013, Albáñez-Lucero and Arreguín-Sánchez 2014, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2014, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). It is unclear whether the seasonal fishery closures have provided an opportunity to recover or not. Brulé et al. (2015) concluded that the hook size regulation in the Yucatan artisanal fishery provides little, if any, improvement. Furthermore, the current minimum size limit 36.3 cm total length is not enough and enforcement of this protective measure is currently unknown. Giménez-Hurtado (2005) proposed prohibiting fishing from zero to 20 metres depth to reduce juvenile mortality, extending the annual fishery closure to February-April to include east of the continental shelf to protect spawners, and prohibiting fishing deeper than 70 m to protect large adults and designate protected areas in critical habitats. These recommendations are supported by studies on catchability (López-Rocha and Arreguín-Sánchez 2008, López-Rocha <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Brazil, marine protected areas (MPAs) are the main conservation tool for populations of this species, including the Abrolhos National Marine Park. Freitas et al. (2017) identified potential additional sites for protection on the Abrolhos Bank that are located outside the current MPA network. Recently, two large MPAs were established within a mosaic of MPAs around the oceanic archipelagos of St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks and Trindade and Martim Vaz. This area covers approximately 900,000 square kilometres, which increased coverage from 1.5% to about 21% of Brazilian waters. A fishing moratorium that included this species was established in 2014 by the Ministry of Environment (MMA 2014), although this has never been effectively implemented.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is more common on continental coasts rather than insular areas due to habitat preference; for example, it is rarely caught in the West Indies including Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, St. Martin, St. Eustatius, Saba (Nagelkerken 1981), the U.S. Virgin Islands (Randall 1961) and Puerto Rico (G. Garcia-Moliner pers. comm. 2016). It supports fisheries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Moe 1969), Campeche Bank (Solis 1970), Isla Margarita (Cervigon 1966) and Brazil (Stevenson 1981). Gene flow between populations in the Florida Keys and Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico likely occurs (Zatcoff&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). In a comparison of fishery-independent longline surveys conducted over the West Florida Shelf and the Campeche Bank in 2001-2002, Red Grouper were significantly smaller in size and had a higher relative abundance on the Campeche Bank than those on the West Florida Shelf, which may be driven by historical fishing pressure, management regulations or available area carrying capacity (Lombardi-Carlson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008a). According to various types of fisheries data, including landings, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and modelled spawning stock and total biomass, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% over the past three generation lengths, which is a period of about 51 years.<strong><br/><br/>Mexico:&#160;</strong>&#160;This species represents the most important species by catch and weight in&#160;the Mexican grouper fishery, of which&#160;83% occurs in the Gulf of Mexico on the Campeche Bank<span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">&#160;off the Yucatan Peninsula (Colás-Marrufo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, SAGARPA 2012). From 1998 to 2008, average annual mixed grouper landings in the southern Gulf of Mexico were 828 mt for Veracruz, 810 mt for Quintana Roo (Caribbean), 657 mt for Tabasco, 152 mt for Campeche and 129 mt for Tamaulipas (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;<em>Epinephelus morio</em> comprised about 95% of the total finfish catch in the Mexican offshore fleet during the 1970s, 50-60% from 2004 to 2011 and about 82% in 2014/2015 (SAGARPA 2012, Monroy-García&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Therefore, even though grouper species-specific landings are not collected, it is inferred that declines in the mixed grouper fishery represent declines of <em>Epinephelus morio</em> (E.

Immature individuals are also captured by the Mexican inshore fishery, which operates in shallower parts of the Campeche Bank (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Giménez-Hurtado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Salas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). Size for both females and males, and size at first sexual maturity and at sex reversal, all decreased between 1989-1992 and 2003-2004, likely due to overfishing (Caballero-Arango&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). This species is still highly valued and effort appears to be increasing (H. Espinosa-Perez pers. comm. 2014).</span><strong><br/><br/>United States:&#160;</strong>This species and the Gag Grouper (<em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>) are the most frequently captured species in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico commercial grouper fishery, which is concentrated on the West Florida Shelf, especially the Florida Middle Grounds&#160;(Smith&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1975, Bullock and Smith 1991, Koenig and Coleman 2013). In U.S. waters, there are two separately managed populations/stocks: the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Regular stock assessments are conducted by Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review scientists, with SEDAR42 (2015) being the most recent assessment of the Gulf stock and SEDAR53 (2017) the most recent assessment of the South Atlantic stock. Estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) indicate that the Gulf of Mexico stock was overfished between 1986 and 1995, but improved from 1996 to 2013, except for 2000 and 2005. Overall, total biomass increased between 1986 and 2005, which corresponded to declines in fishing mortality. The 2006 Gulf of Mexico stock assessment did not consider this population to be overfished nor to be experiencing overfishing and that the stock had fully recovered (SEDAR12 2006, Cass-Calay and Brown 2007). Overall, total biomass and spawning stock biomass have been increasing in the Gulf of Mexico stock since 2006 (SEDAR42 2015). The predicted biomass in 2006 was at a record low due to the red tide event in 2005, but has increased since.&#160;The Gulf of Mexico stock was considered rebuilt in 2007, and abundance has generally been increasing since 1986, which is a time period of about 30 years. Fishing regulations, at least in part, caused a 70% reduction in recreational harvest by number and a 41% reduction by weight as well as a 21% reduction in commercial harvest in 1990 (Schirripa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). SEDAR19 (2010) was the first formal stock assessment of the South Atlantic stock, which reported that it was overfished with overfishing occurring.&#160;The South Atlantic stock is not yet considered rebuilt since low abundances were documented in the 1980s and early 1990s, but a rebuilding plan has been in place since 2012. According to SEDAR53 (2017), the total biomass and spawning stock biomass declined until the late 1980s, increased until 2006 and declined thereafter by 70% (past 10 years). The stock assessment concluded that the south Atlantic stock is currently overfished with overfishing occurring.<strong><br/><br/>Brazil</strong>: In Brazil, species-specific grouper fisheries data are not available (IBAMA 2006). Until the 1980s, the commercial fishery operating in Abrolhos primarily targeted large groupers, including 'badejo' (<em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em>) and 'garoupa' (<em>Epinephelus morio</em>). With the decline of this fishery, a new market developed for smaller grouper and snapper species, and only 11% of the fleet were targeting large grouper by the year 2000 (Martins <em>et al. </em>2005). The CPUE estimated in the depleted phase (1.4 kg/fisher/day) by Costa <em>et al</em>. (2003) is considerably lower than that in the late 1970s (12 kg/day/fisher). More recently, in the Abrolhos Bank, the CPUE for <em>E. morio</em> declined by 70% from 2005-2007 (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2007). A regional Red List initiative in Brazil listed <em>E. morio</em>&#160;as Vulnerable and the FAO landings reported by Brazil showed a&#160;decline along decades: from 1970 to 1980 (61%), from 1980 to 1990 (30%), from 1990 to 2000 (56%), and from 2000 to 2010 (16%), representing an overall decline from 1970 to 2015 (45 years) of 77.3%.&#160;</span></span></span></p><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

In Indonesia, the trade limit is significantly lower than the length at first maturity which indicates that trade encourages capture of immature individuals impairing the sustainability of the stock.

Fisheries management is only in place in the Seychelles and Western Australia. Fisheries regulations are reasonably well-enforced in the Seychelles. The live reef food fish trade in the Seychelles was closed by the early 2000s due to sustainability concerns, conflicts with local fishers, biodiversity and economic viability (Aumeeruddy and Robinson 2006). This species receives some protection in no-take protected areas in South Africa, southern Mozambique, Chagos and Kenya. Fisheries management is well established in Western Australia through five separate commercial fishing zones for a mixed demersal fishery, which includes&#160;this species. The management plans are under review due to concerns of growth overfishing. Ningaloo Marine Park in Australia, which is closed to commercial fishing, provides some protection to this species (Stephenson <em>et al.</em> 2001). Demersal fishing rules for the recreational fishery in Australia are also applicable to this species<span lang=""""EN-IN"""">.</p>",Decreasing,"This&#160;is considered to be a common species throughout its range (Craig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), though can be relatively uncommon in some areas.&#160;It&#160;has three geographically separated sub-populations based on differences in colour pattern and scale counts: 1. Western Indian Ocean;&#160;2. Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman; 3. northwestern Australia and Indonesia. Species-specific population information is limited in some areas and some landings are unreported (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, FAO 2016). There are some indications of declines in parts of its range due to overfishing, including in the Seychelles (declining catch rates up to 50%), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (Persian Gulf), Reunion and the Rodrigues Islands, but overall, the species is unlikely to have declined more than 30% over its global range (Bunce<em> et al</em>. 2008, Pistorius and Taylor 2009, Al-Zaidan <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2016).&#160;<p><strong>Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman:</strong> Species-specific landings were first reported to FAO by Saudi Arabia (Persian Gulf) in the early 2000s with 1,100 tonnes in 2001 and from 2002-2010 average landings were around 400 tonnes per year, increased in 2011 and 2012 to more than 1,000 tonnes and declined thereafter to 49 tonnes in 2014 (FAO 2016). This represents a 96% decline over a 13 year time period. In Kuwait, it is targeted by the artisanal fishery, where fishery production doubled between 1980 and mid-2000s and is expected to continue increasing (Al-Zaidan<em> et al</em>. 2016). In 2004-2005, Kuwait's local gargoor trap fishery landed 13.4 kg of&#160;<em>Epinephelus multinotatus</em>, which comprised 0.17% of the total catch by weight (Chen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Aggregate grouper landings reported from Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain over the past 24 years show no clear trend (FAO 2013). From 2004-2008, landings of this species&#160;in Bahrain were 0.5 metric tonnes in 2004 and 0.3 mt in 2008, and from 2009-2012, no landings of this species were recorded (E. Abdulqader pers. comm. 2013). From 1979-2012, landings of this species&#160;in Kuwait fluctuated with 186 mt harvested in 1979 and 2,059 mt in 2012, with a peak of 5,355 mt in 1986 (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013). Deeper-water groupers of large size are extensively fished in Oman and the Arabian Sea both by line fishing and trawling, and concerns have been raised that this assemblage is subject to high levels of fishing in Oman (J. McIlwain unpublished data). Aggregate fisheries catch statistics for groupers indicate a 43% decline over a range of 3-11 years and effort is likely to increase over the next 10-15 years in the region.&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Western Australia:</strong>&#160;Genetically different stocks are considered in Shark Bay, Ningaloo, Pilbara and Broome in Western Australia, which supports the current approach of four separate fisheries management plans for this species there (Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Landings of this species in Australia averaged about 120 tonnes/year from 2000-2010 with no clear trend (Zeller and Pauly 2015). It is taken in commercial multispecies demersal trawl fisheries in Pilbara and by trap and line fisheries in Broome and is considered the most heavily fished grouper species in Western Australia&#160;(Stephenson<span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001).&#160;</p><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><p><strong>Western Indian Ocean: </strong>During shallow underwater surveys conducted from 2009-2015&#160;in 6 countries (Tanzania, northern Mozambique, northeastern Madagascar, Comoros, Chagos and Isles Glorieuses) only one individual of this species was observed&#160;in Chagos. Additional surveys found 2 individuals – one in northern Kenya and one in northeastern Madagascar (M. Samoilys unpublished data). This suggests that this species is rare or does not typically occur on shallow reefs. It is possibly naturally uncommon in mainland East Africa as it was not observed in underwater surveys (to ~20 m depth) along the Kenyan coast in the past (Samoilys 1988), or in southern Tanzania’s Mnazi Bay Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (Obura 2004), though this may be a reflection of its deeper depth preferences. This species&#160;was relatively abundant in the Seychelles and was the most common of the three grouper species taken in demersal handline fisheries there (Mees 1992, MRAG 1996). Densities in shallow (less than 20 metres depth) in the Seychelles ranged from 0 to 0.51 fish/1,000 m², with higher densities found in the Amirantes Isles (Pears 2005). Its population in the Seychelles was overfished by at least 2007 (J. Robinson pers. comm. 2007). Fishing activity on spawning aggregations in the Seychelles can yield between 400 and 8,000 kg in a single fishing trip (Robinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). A 61% decline in catch per unit effort over a ten year period (1996-2007) was documented in Aldabra’s marine protected area (Seychelles) based on landings from a small subsistence fishery and the decline is thought to be caused mainly by reef degradation (Pistorius and Taylor 2009). In 2009, catch in the hook and line fishery of the Seychelles totaled 2.2 tonnes (WIOfish 2016).&#160;This species is one of the 19 grouper species&#160;taken in the small-scale artisanal fishery around Réunion and estimated total catches declined from about 20 to 45 mt from 1998 to 2002, and further to 3 mt in 2004-2005, and no effort data are available (D. Miossec pers. comm. 2007). According to fishermen in the Rodrigues Islands, this species reportedly declined by number and body size over the past 25 years (Bunce <em>et al.</em> 2008). Very limited deeper (30 m) fisheries occur in East Africa, though hook and line, seine, traps and trawl are listed for taking groupers in Tanzanian waters. Some illegal foreign fishing vessels trawling the shelf area beyond territorial waters may be taking this species (Samoilys 2004).<em>&#160;</em>It is reported from&#160;catches in 2000, 2002 and 2003 of the commercial hook and line fishery of Mozambique (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2007). The relative abundance of this species in artisanal fisheries in southern Kenya was low (1-5% of grouper catch (Agembe&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Landings are known to be unreported in some countries of East Africa (Jacquet<em> et al.</em> 2010).&#160;</p></span>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Although this species also inhabits rocky reefs, these are unlikely to be able to compensate for the loss of quality coral reef habitat. Between 1970-2011 (41 years), an overall 59% decline in coral cover was directly observed in the Caribbean, which was caused by anthropogenic stressors, <em>Diadema antillarum</em> decline, and coral disease (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has also been identified as a prey item of the invasive Lionfish, with only juveniles being consumed (Morris and Akins 2009, Green <em>et al.</em> 2012). Lionfish may also compete with Nassau Grouper for reef shelter (Raymond<em> et al.</em> 2015).","Conservation strategies for this species vary widely by country, and include a total ban on take, fishing restrictions and area/temporal protection for spawning aggregations (Garcia-Moliner and Sadovy 2008).&#160;In March 2017, the Nassau Grouper was added to Annex III of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol, which is a legally binding regional environmental treaty for the Wider Caribbean region. This confers some regional protection for the species with most countries within its range being signatories except Mexico. For species listed under Annex III, exploitation is authorized but must be regulated so as to maintain populations at an optimal level. However, historical issues with low compliance and insufficient enforcement lessens the potential for in-place fishing regulations to allow populations to recover in many countries. Furthermore, even areas that have enacted effectively-enforced protection for a decade or more have documented only minimal to no recovery of populations. Some countries have established marine protected areas (MPAs) based on the localities of spawning aggregations. It has been raised successfully in a hatchery, but not at a commercial scale. Although removing fishing effort on aggregations is a very important conservation action for this species, focusing protection only on spawning aggregations is likely to be insufficient, and migratory routes should also be considered (Dahlgren <em>et al</em>. 2016). According to Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al</em>. (2012) conservation priorities are as follows: (1) prevent overfishing of spawning aggregations; (2) protect sub-adult fish capture by establishing a minimum size limit at or above the size of sexual maturation; (3) protect remnant populations from fishing; (4) improve enforcement of fishery closures and address illegal, unmonitored and unregulated trade; (5) implement regional management strategies where the SPAW&#160; protocol might be applicable; (6) decisions may be needed in countries with remaining viable populations of Nassau grouper as to whether this species should be retained for food security or export trade or conserved for tourism and reef health. A precautionary and regional approach to management of remaining Nassau Grouper populations is essential to reduce the further declines (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2016). Further research is also needed on formation of aggregations, individual spawning frequency, reproductive output in small versus large aggregations, update surveys of lesser-studied historical aggregations and establish regular monitoring of aggregations.<br/><br/>In U.S. federal and state waters, which includes Puerto Rico (since 2004) and the Virgin Islands, there has been a total ban on fishing for Nassau Grouper since 1992. Three spawning aggregation sites in the Bahamas - High Cay and two sites off eastern Long Island - were protected by law in 1999. Fishing for Nassau Grouper was also banned throughout the Bahamas in 2000. However, enforcement has been mostly lacking (N. Nuttall pers. comm.). Currently, there is a fishing and sales ban from December to February. It has been recommended that fishing effort in the Bahamas be reduced to 2001 levels to avoid further overexploitation (Cheung<em> et al</em>. 2013). In 1997, the Mexican fishery authority banned fishing of Nassau Grouper during spawning aggregation season (December to February; Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009), but this regulation has since disappeared with a change in the law. There has been a one-month ban on grouper fishing in Mexico since 2005, and in 2014, this ban was extended to two months (Aguilar-Perera 2016). In the Mexican Caribbean, several important spawning sites are located within MPAs (e.g., Xcalak Reef National Park and Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve; Medina Quej <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fulton<em> et al</em>. 2016). Under the “Refugios Pesqueros” (Fishery Refuges) initiative, the Mexican fishing authority (CONAPESCA) also designated several no-take areas based on the request of fishing organizations with civil support (Diario Oficial de la Federación 2012).&#160;In Belize, fishing on&#160;most Nassau Grouper aggregations has been banned since 2002, with all&#160;thirteen known sites protected since 2012. In addition, there is&#160;a four month closed season and catch size limits&#160;(Burns-Perez and Tewfik 2016).&#160;In the Cayman Islands, gear has been restricted to line-fishing only and fishing during spawning season in three main 'grouper holes' has been permitted only for residents since 1978 (P. Bush pers. comm. 2001). In 2003, fishing was closed at all known spawning sites for a period of eight years with an extension in 2011 for another eight years. Numbers of individuals in at least one aggregation have increased since (Department of Environment 2011, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2012). In August of 2016, the Cayman Islands government enacted a comprehensive set of regulations aimed at Nassau Grouper that represent the most progressive set of management actions throughout its range. These actions include: (1) All take, possession, or sale of Nassau Grouper is prohibited during spawning season from December through April (2) When take is permitted (May through November), only fish between 16""""-24” can be kept and no more than 5 per fishing vessel per day (3) Spearfishing is prohibited. Grouper fishing is prohibited in the Dominican Republic during spawning season and a quota system was introduced in Cuba (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In Bermuda, Nassau Grouper fishing has been banned since 1996 and there are several no-take MPAs, but the population has made no appreciable recovery (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).",Decreasing,"Within its range, this species was naturally abundant in areas with large shelf platform habitat, such as Belize, the Bahamas, Cuba and others of the Greater Antilles, and less abundant in areas such as continental South America (e.g., Colombia and Venezuela; Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017). There&#160;is evidence that there is strong genetic differentiation among Nassau Grouper subpopulations in the Caribbean region (Jackson<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>A summary of population status and trends in Table 1 of the Supplementary Information. During the first U.S. survey of the fishery resources of Puerto Rico, this species was noted as a common and very important food fish, reaching a weight of 50 lbs (22.7 kg) or more (Evermann 1900). In 1970, it was still a common shallow water species landed in Puerto Rico (Thompson 1978), the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Belize and elsewhere. Data on all&#160;known spawning aggregation sites&#160;have been collected&#160;and are collated in the Science and Conservation of Fish Aggregations (SCRFA) database&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). In the past, aggregations were estimated to consist of 10,000 to 30,000 and up to 100,000 individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972; Olsen and LaPlace 1979; Colin<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1987; Fine 1990, 1992; Carter&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994; Sadovy 1997). Aggregations still reported to exist as of 2007 had greatly declined due to overexploitation and contained only 100 to rarely 3,000 individuals, with declines ongoing since then (Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Over the past 40 years, widespread overfishing has occurred for this species in most countries across its range, with many populations now commercially non-viable. Due to intense fishing effort during spawning season, the size of aggregations has severely declined (from 10,000-100,000 individuals per aggregation to 100-3,000 individuals; greater than 90% decline), and the number of known individual aggregations has been reduced from at least 50 to less than 20 (a 60% decline; Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2008, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2012).Underwater surveys and fishery data indicate that abundance is very low in almost all areas as compared to historical levels (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013). Underwater surveys conducted between 2003-2013 that are collated in the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) database show very low density and sighting frequencies in about 20 countries except the Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands and parts of the Bahamas. Depending on the country, subpopulations are likely to either be stable (e.g., the U.S.) or in decline (e.g., Cuba, Belize, Puerto Rico), and despite conservation measures in several countries, there has been very limited to no recovery of overexploited populations. Several countries where fishing pressure has also been high, but where quantitative data are not available or only anecdotal reports exist (e.g., Jamaica), are inferred to have experienced declines at the same level as countries with quantitative data (e.g., the Bahamas).&#160;Based on the decline in spawning aggregations (60%) over the past 36 years (1980-2016; two generation lengths) and the likelihood that the population will continue to decline&#160;into the future due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, an exponential regression was applied to calculate the decline over three generation lengths (1980-2031), resulting in a 73% decline.&#160;However, as the size of the spawning aggregations has also substantially declined over this time period, it is highly likely that this is an underestimate, and the global population will decline by more than 80% over the three generation length time window that includes both the past and the future. For example, a conservative estimate of 10,000 individuals per aggregation in the 1980s and 3,000 individuals in 2016 would result in an overall population decline of 95% over the three generation length time window (1980-2031).<br/><strong><br/>Bermuda:&#160;</strong>Fishery landings in Bermuda were once dominated by grouper and snapper before their populations severely declined (Burnett-Herkes and Barnes 1996). In 1975, Nassau Grouper comprised 16% of the total grouper catch by weight, but declined to less than 1% of the catch by 1989 (Bannerot<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1987, Report of the Commission of Inquiry Bermuda 1991). According to fisher interviews, all four known historical aggregations no longer formed and had probably crashed by 1981 (Bannerot&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1987, Luckhurst 1996). Despite subsequent protection, the fishery remains commercially non-viable (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>U.S. continental:<em>&#160;</em></strong><span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">The fishery for this species in the continental U.S. has been closed since 1992 and possession is prohibited (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Despite these measures, spawning aggregations, including in the Dry Tortugas off Florida, have not recovered (Ault&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">&#160;2013).&#160;<br/></span><strong><br/>Mexico:&#160;</strong>According to fisher interviews, the large aggregations on Alacranes Reef off Mexico have been exhausted by overfishing and spawning activity has not been documented at all in recent years (Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2012). A historically large aggregation of about 1,000-15,000 individuals also disappeared off Mahahual, Mexico in 1996 (Aguilar-Perera and Aguilar-Davila 1996, Aguilar-Perera 2006). Surveys conducted since then indicate that the aggregation has not recovered (Aguilar-Perera 2014). According to fishers, another aggregation south of Playa del Carmen at Punta Iná was also extirpated during the early 1980s (Sosa-Cordero <em>et al.</em> 2009). An aggregation of about 2,000 individuals remains off Punta Gavilán in southern Quintana Roo (Medina-Quej <em>et al</em>. 2004, Aguilar-Perera <em>et al. </em>2009, Fulton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Only five out of the 28 spawning aggregations along the Mexican Caribbean coast mentioned by fishers&#160;during interviews have been scientifically validated (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al.</em> 2009). An aggregation of at least 1,000 individuals&#160;was recently confirmed in the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve (Fulton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aggregate annual grouper landings in the Mexican Caribbean declined from 19,200 kg in 1998 to 4,000 kg in 2005, which is a period of about seven years (Aguilar-Perera<em> et al</em>. 2009, Sosa-Cordero <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Bahamas:</strong>&#160;The population of Nassau Grouper in the Bahamas was one of the largest across its range. It has been a historically important component of Bahamian fisheries which primarily targeted spawning aggregations (Colin 1992) and the first and largest ever reported aggregation (30,000 to 100,000 fish) was documented in Bimini by Lavett-Smith (1972). To date, at least 31 aggregation sites&#160;have been reported (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2012), and 23 have been confirmed by direct observation or catch monitoring (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In the 1970-1980s, aggregations ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972, Colin 1992).&#160;By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the population in the Bahamas was likely fully exploited to overexploited and aggregations were significantly reduced in size (Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007, Cheung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Reported annual landings from 1994 to 2011 declined by about 83% (650 tonnes to 113 tonnes). In addition to landings, mean body size of individuals in the catch has also declined since the 1990s and the proportion of Nassau Grouper in the catch declined from 10% to 4% from 1994 to 2009 (Cheung <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Landings of this species in the Bahamas declined by 86% since 1997&#160;(18 years), and despite fishery management measures, recovery has not occurred (Sherman<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016)<span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">. </span>Underwater reef surveys also recorded declines in numbers of observed Nassau Grouper over time.&#160;In 1992, over 20 spawning aggregations were&#160;being exploited across the Bahamas (NMFS 1992, R. Thompson pers. comm). The current status of many of these is unknown largely due to the lack of survey work in recent years: only four have been reported in recent scientific literature (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted during the spawning season of 2013 at the aggregation site originally described by Lavett-Smith (1972) failed to find any sign of Nassau Grouper (Erisman <em>et al.</em> 2014). Diver and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in January 2002 around Long Island in the Bahamas at a known historically large aggregation site found no more than 28 individuals per survey and no spawning behaviour was observed (Gascoigne 2002, D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). Interviews with local fishers further indicated that spawning aggregations no longer occurred in the area (D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). The aggregation at High Cay was also reported to consist of an order of magnitude fewer spawners than its historical size (Gascoigne 2002, Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007). Hydroacoustic surveys conducted at High Cay recorded&#160;10,523 kg of fish in 1999, 9,300 in 2000 and 12,857 in 2001, although the reliability of this method has not been validated. Dive surveys conducted at this site in 2000-2001 found no evidence of an aggregation (Carleton Ray<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2000, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;A recent study of genetic structure in the Bahamas showed that this species continues to support mostly high levels of genetic diversity with no evidence for geographic population structure and there is significant, but weak, genetic differentiation in Nassau Grouper throughout the Bahamian archipelago. Analyses of the last 1,000 generations indicate a pronounced historic decline in Bahamian Nassau Grouper that appears to pre-date anthropogenic fishing activities. There is additional evidence that population bottlenecks have occurred in several sites (Sherman <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><strong><br/>Turks and Caicos:</strong><em>&#160;</em>This species is highly valued by the dive tourism and restaurant industries in the Turk and Caicos. Fishing pressure has been relatively low historically and the population appears to be healthy (Rudd 2003, Vo <em>et al</em>. 2014), although effort to supply local markets has recently increased (Dept. of Environment and Coastal Resources Turks and Caicos Islands 2008).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Cuba:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Historically, this was among the most important finfish species landed in Cuban fisheries, yielding some of the highest catches anywhere within its geographic range (Claro<em> et al.</em> 2001). Fishing pressure increased notably after 1959, with landings reaching 1,700 metric tonnes in 1963 and declining thereafter. The majority of landings were taken from spawning aggregations in the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago&#160;(Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003). Until 1969, some of this catch was obtained from the Bahamas shelf.&#160;Landings data, which have been collected monthly since the 1960s, indicate a sharp decline occurred after 1969 partly due to the closure of the fishery in Sabana-Camaguey and&#160;targeting of spawning aggregations (Claro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001, 2009). Despite some protective management, a sudden collapse occurred in the late 1970s. Overall finfish landings gradually increased between 1962 and 1998 presumably due to increasing fishing effort, but Nassau Grouper declined steeply (Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003, Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2008). By 2008, only a few spawning aggregations remained viable off Cuba (Claro <em>et al. </em>2009). The species is still captured by recreational fishers, but the population cannot support a viable commercial fishery. According to landings data and spawning aggregation studies, the population in Cuba is suspected to have declined by more than 80% over the past 30 years (three generations) (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Dominican Republic:</strong>&#160;This species is primarily captured in the trap fishery in the Dominican Republic (Munro and Thompson 1983). Landings have not been reported from the Dominican Republic for many years, and the species appears to have been severely depleted in local waters. Poaching by Dominican vessels in Bahamian waters for this species has been reported.<br/><strong><br/>Continental South America:&#160;</strong>This species occurs in continental South America, but aggregations have not been reported, and landings are no longer significant (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Belize:<em> </em></strong>Historically this species was extremely abundant in Belize (Craig 1966, Paz and Grimshaw 2001). However, many aggregations have been severely reduced, such as at Mexico Rocks, Rise and Fall Bank and Caye Glory (<span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">Paz and Grimshaw&#160;</span>2001). The aggregation at Caye Glory reportedly supported tens of thousands of individuals and catch once exceeded an estimated 30,000 fish during just one spawning season (Craig 1966). In the late 1960s, grouper catches reached two tons per day at Caye Glory, but a survey conducted in January of 2001 recorded just 21 fish and fishermen caught only nine fish over four days (Heyman and Wade 2007). At least 15 spawning aggregation sites are known from Belize, and regular surveys of 14 of them indicate that only a few hundred to a few thousand fish remain today (Burns Perez and Tewfick 2016). All these aggregation sites have undergone dramatic declines in fish abundance over the past two decades and despite some protective measures that have reduced fishing effort on these aggregations, recovery does not appear to be occurring. Northeast Point off Glover’s Reef Atoll, which is one of the last viable (larger) spawning aggregations of Nassau Grouper in Belize, has varied in abundance with peaks of more than 3,000 individuals in 2001, 2005 and 2010, but generally declined by over 85% to 450 individuals in 2015. This decline coincides with the occurrence of illegal fishing in the area (Burns Perez and Tewfik 2016).<br/><strong><br/>Honduras and Nicaragua: </strong>This species is commercially exploited in&#160;Honduras and Nicaragua, but catch data are not available. Imports of this species into the U.S. from these countries, as reported by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, have declined since the 1990s. In Honduras, it appears likely that catch of Nassau Grouper has diminished since 2005 (Box and Bonilla 2008, Arrivillaga 2011). A two-year fishery survey conducted in the Bay Islands of Honduras reported the occurrence of immature Nassau Grouper individuals in the artisanal fishery in east Roatán and Guanaja (Gobert<em> et al.</em> 2005). Nassau Grouper landings in the Bay Islands increased until the late 1980s to early 1990s before declining by 2003 due to uncontrolled fishing of spawning aggregations in the 1990s (Box and Bonilla 2008). For example, an aggregation near Guanaja was reduced from approximately 10,000 fish to less than 500 in two years and appears to have been eradicated in the early 1990s (Fine 1990, 1992), but has not been surveyed since. Fishers have reported the existence of several other spawning sites, but their condition is unknown. The aggregation at Banco Campiche is still likely to exist in part due to its inaccessibility (Box and Bonilla 2008). Anecdotal accounts from fishers as well as reductions in exports of Nassau and Red Grouper over the past few decades also indicate population declines have occurred (Box and Bonilla 2008, Canty and Box 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Lesser Antilles:&#160;</strong>Little is known of the status of this species in the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and reported catches are generally low (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Jamaica:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Fishing effort in Jamaica increased significantly with the advent of motorized boats and mechanized gears, which led to lower catch rates of all reef fish and the disappearance of some species, including the Nassau Grouper, from multispecies catches (Stevenson 1981). Fishery surveys conducted in the early 1970s in Jamaica recorded a catch per unit effort of 1.4 to 1.7 kg of Nassau Grouper per hour (Munro 1983).&#160;An underwater survey of reef fishes in Jamaica in 1986 revealed no groupers (Koslow <em>et al.</em> 1988), and by 1989, Nassau Grouper were rarely caught (Sadovy 1997). Its current status in Jamaica is not well-understood.<br/><strong><br/>Cayman Islands:&#160;</strong>Catches of Nassau Grouper in the Cayman Islands have declined since 1996 due to overfishing (Whaylen<em> et al.</em> 2004, Bush<em> et al.</em> 2006). However, according to surveys conducted on several spawning aggregations, this species&#160;may still be relatively abundant in the Cayman Islands, which is also one of few places within its range where the fishery is effectively managed (Patengill-Semmens and Semmens 2003). Surveys conducted from 2003 to 2013 recorded 1,857 Nassau Grouper individuals during 3,746 surveys (density index 1.7, sighting frequency 49.6%) in the Cayman Islands (REEF 2013). Five&#160;aggregation sites are confirmed in the Cayman Islands, with one off western Little Cayman likely to be the largest remaining aggregation (in terms of fish numbers) throughout its global range. This aggregation is still considered healthy despite two years of heavy fishing pressure; during 20 days of fishing in the 2001 and 2002 spawning season, approximately 4,000 fish were taken (Whaylen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Pre-fishing abundance for this aggregation was estimated at over 7,000 fish (Bush<em> et al. </em>2006). According to studies conducted between 1987 and 2001, three of the Cayman Island aggregations were considered overfished with catch in the low hundreds and continuing to decline (Bush<em> et al.</em> 2006). The Little Cayman east end site was abandoned by fishers in 1993 when the aggregation ceased to form.&#160;Following the re-discovery of the spawning aggregation in Cayman Brac, catch was in the low thousands during the initial years, but it has declined drastically in the past six years. Based on a mark-recapture study conducted in Cayman Brac, fishermen were capturing 15-20% of the spawning population outside the spawning season, which indicates that the Nassau Grouper population may continue to decline even with a closure of the fishery during spawning season (B. Semmens pers. comm. 2012).<br/><strong><br/>Puerto Rico:<em>&#160;</em></strong>This species once dominated catches in Puerto Rico from the 1950s to 1970s, but began declining in the 1980s and by 1988-1989 was rare and represented only 2% of grouper landings and 0.2% of all demersal fish species (Sadovy 1993, Sadovy and Eklund 1999, PRDNR 2012). By 1990, it was considered commercially non-viable (Matos-Caraballo 2008).&#160;In Puerto Rico, landings of this species are available for the 17 year period of 1998-2011, landings declined from a high of 19,085&#160;lbs in 1998 to 260 lbs in 2011, which represents a 99% decline over a 13 year period (Matos-Caraballo 2012; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><strong style=""""""""><br/>U.S. Virgin Islands:<em>&#160;</em></strong>By 1981, Nassau Grouper had practically disappeared from local fishery catches in the Greater Antilles (CFMC 1985), and by 1986, it was considered commercially non-viable in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (Bohnsack <em>et al</em>. 1986). Its current status in this area is poorly known. The Nassau Grouper fishery collapsed in the USVI in the late 1970s (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), and no significant spawning aggregation formed afterwards. One aggregation in the 1970s contained an estimated 2,000-3,000 individuals (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), but is no longer viable today. Fishermen have reported a possible recurrence of an aggregation south of St. John (D. Olsen pers. comm. 2011) and dive surveys conducted in 2001-2004 indicate that an aggregation may be re-forming at Grammanik Bank south of St. Thomas (Nemeth <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2010). Further work conducted in 2004-2006 documented some increased settlement/recruitment in nearshore habitats in both St. Thomas and St. John (Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Rhodes and Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data). A market survey conducted in 2014 in Chuuk, Micronesia identified an unknown number of individuals of this species of sizes between 25 and 45 cm total length, with a mean of 33.6 cm. It comprised 0.7% of total marketed reef fish volume, with 6% of individuals taken by hook and line and 94% by nighttime spearfishing (Cuetos-Bueno and Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data).

It is mainly caught with bottom longlines and deep handlines, and is marketed fresh or frozen (Anderson and Allen 2001). It is one of the principal species in the Hawaiian offshore handline fishery. There are indications that some fish stocks on Hawaiian banks have been severely over-fished (Haight <em>et al</em>. 1993). Misa et al. (2013) found that E. carbunculus had an estimated spawning potential ratio well below 20%, indicating that the stock is in a state of recruitment overfishing. Fishery reports for the Hawaiian Islands indicate that the catch rates of <em>E. carbunculus</em>  have declined steadily since the 1950s, and have dropped more steeply in the last 10 to 15 years. As the catch rates have dropped, so have the proportion of mature fish in the catches (DAR 2002). The Hawaiian landings of this species have dropped from approximately 18,100 kg in 1998 to 10,900 kg in 2003. Moffitt (1980) noted that the CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort) was 0.06 to 0.08 kg/line hr in the North West Hawaiian Islands in 1980.&#160;Over the last 40 to 50 years, partial CPUE &#160;has been reduced to half of what it once was (Hawaii's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy 2006). This species is considered locally depleted in the middle Hawaiian Islands, whilst all bottomfish populations are considered relatively healthy in the North Western Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy 2006).<br/>This species<em></em> is also commercially fished in the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDWTF) in south-western Australia. This species has been intensely fished in this area and due to its aggregatory behaviour with preference for restricted continental shelf habitats, it is vulnerable to heavy fishing. As a result it is reported to be over-fished in this area and the catch rates of this species are thought to have fallen (Hunter 2008).","There are no species-specific conservation measures for<em> Etelis carbunculus;</em>&#160;however, the distribution of this species intersects within numerous marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP 2014).<br/>Monitoring of the harvest levels is needed with further research on the extent of the fishery. Conservation measures need to protect important spawning aggregations.<br/><br/>In federal waters of the US Western Pacific, the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council manages the Deep 7 bottomfish species. Previously these species were managed under the Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, but since 2010 have been managed under the Hawaii Fishery Ecosystem Plan (WPRFMC 2009) (WPFMC 2010).&#160;Management measures under the federal plan include a ban on destructive fishing techniques, a prohibition on fishing at Hancock Seamount, size limits, limits on fishing effort, gear restrictions, a recreational bag limit, and catch reporting (WPRFMC 2010). As well, a total allowable catch limit is set for the Deep 7 bottomfish species. For the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fishing years, the annual catch limit was set at 346,000 lbs. (FR 2013). If the catch limits is project to be reached, the fishery for the Deep 7 bottomfish may be closed. If the catch limit is exceeded, the catch limit for the following season may be reduced by the amount of the overage.&#160; In state waters the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (HDAR) part of the Department of Land and Natural Resources, is responsible for fisheries management. Management measures in state waters include annual vessel registration, catch reporting, gear restrictions, minimum sizes (Onaga and Opakapaka) and closed fishing areas (DLNR 2013). If the fishery for the Deep 7 is closed in federal waters because the annual catch limit is reached, the State may close their waters to fishing for the Deep 7 species as well. Management goals for abundance and fishing levels have been established for the Deep 7 complex as a whole but not for individual species (Brodziak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

It is managed to varying degrees throughout its range. In the Hawaiian Islands, this species is part of the subset of deepwater fishes known as the """"Deep 7"""" and is managed by total allowable catch (TAC) regulations. In response to overfishing in the late 1990s, the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources implemented 19 Bottomfish Restricted Fishing Areas throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, which covered 20% of the essential fish habitat for this species (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2013). Maintaining &lt;0.1&#160;fishing mortality&#160;was recommended as a cautious approach to management of this species in New Caledonia (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/>In federal waters of the US Western Pacific, the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council manages the Deep 7 bottomfish species. Previously these species were managed under the Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, but since 2010 have been managed under the Hawaii Fishery Ecosystem Plan (WPRFMC 2009) (WPFMC 2010).&#160;Management measures under the federal plan include a ban on destructive fishing techniques, a prohibition on fishing at Hancock Seamount, size limits, limits on fishing effort, gear restrictions, a recreational bag limit, and catch reporting (WPRFMC 2010). As well, a total allowable catch limit is set for the Deep 7 bottomfish species. For the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fishing years, the annual catch limit was set at 346,000 lbs. (FR 2013). If the catch limits is project to be reached, the fishery for the Deep 7 bottomfish may be closed. If the catch limit is exceeded, the catch limit for the following season may be reduced by the amount of the overage.&#160; In state waters the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (HDAR) part of the Department of Land and Natural Resources, is responsible for fisheries management. Management measures in state waters include annual vessel registration, catch reporting, gear restrictions, minimum sizes (Onaga and Opakapaka) and closed fishing areas (DLNR 2013). If the fishery for the Deep 7 is closed in federal waters because the annual catch limit is reached, the State may close their waters to fishing for the Deep 7 species as well. Management goals for abundance and fishing levels have been established for the Deep 7 complex as a whole but not for individual species (Brodziak&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). As a result, the impact of the fishery on individual species remains unclear (Blue Ocean Institute 2014).",Unknown,"Individuals found inside deepwater marine protected areas of the main Hawaiian Islands were larger than those recorded outside of the main Hawaiian Islands; however, only in protected areas which had been established for at least 10 years.

The main depth range of this species is within the range of Mediterranean fisheries. However, the ban on bottom trawling below depths of 1,000 m in the Mediterranean, adopted by all members of The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), will  afford protection in the deeper part of its bathymetric range.

In both fisheries, all captured specimens are discarded (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2005a), and even though most are still alive when returned to sea, they usually have severe injuries (due to the long trawling periods or as a result of the hooks) that are likely to impair their survival.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic</strong><br/>In general, very little is known of the threats that affect this species off the African coast.

The reproductive output and recruitment success of krill has been related to the extent, timing and duration of winter sea ice cover. The underside structure of sea ice provides a nursery ground for overwintering krill larvae and a substrate for algae which are their food. Extensive winter sea ice promotes strong spring phytoplankton bloom when retreating in spring which fuels the adults’ reproductive output for their summer spawning season (Quetin and Ross 2001). Krill growth has also been observed to decrease above a temperature optimum of 0.5 degrees Celsius (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Atkinson <em>et al.</em> (2009) estimated the krill biomass for January-February 2000 to be 133 million tonnes. This estimate was based on an acoustic estimate of biomass derived from the CCAMLR2000 survey of the South Atlantic of 37.3 million tonnes which was estimated to be 28% of the global krill biomass. CCAMLR has subsequently revised this biomass estimate (SC-CCAMLR 2010 para. 3.29) to 60.3 million tonnes.

It is also popular and very effective as live bait for sailfish.<br/><br/>Overall trends in the small tuna catch may mask declining trends for individual species because annual landings are often dominated by the landings of a single species. These fluctuations seem to be partly related to unreported catches, as these species generally comprise part of the bycatch and are often discarded, and therefore do not reflect the real catch. The ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) pointed out the relative importance of small tuna fisheries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, which account for 28% of the total reported catch from 1980–2007. Several countries from the Mediterranean and Black Sea are not reporting catches to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is commonly believed that catches of small tunas are strongly affected by unreported or underreported data in all areas. Small tunas are exploited mainly by coastal fisheries and often by artisanal fisheries, although substantial catches are also made, either as target species or as bycatch, by purse seiners, mid-water trawlers, handlines, troll lines, driftnets, surface drifting long-lines and small scale gillnets. Several recreational fisheries also target small tunas. Since 1991, the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by tropical purse-seiners may have led to an increase in fishing mortality of small tropical tuna species (STECF 2009). There is a general lack of information on the mortality of these species as bycatch, exacerbated by the confusion regarding species identification (ICCAT 2009).","It is a highly migratory species listed under Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994). In Turkey there is a minimum landing size of 45 cm.<br/><br/>Data on the catch composition, biology and trends are now available from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)/General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) joint expert group 2008). More information, particularly on specific fishing effort, is needed from all areas. The small tuna fishery seems to be quite important for the coastal communities, both economically and as a source of proteins. No management recommendations have been presented by ICCAT due to the lack of proper data, historical series and analyses. In 2008, the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) reiterated its recommendation to carry out studies to determine the state of these stocks and the adoption of management solutions.&#160; ICCAT/SCRS in 2009 noted that there is an improvement in the availability of catch and biological data for small tuna species particularly in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. However, biological information, catch and effort statistics for small tunas remain incomplete for many of the coastal and industrial fishing countries. Given that, many of these species are of high importance to coastal fishermen, especially in some developing countries, both economically and often as a primary source of proteins, therefore the SCRS recommends that further studies be conducted on small tuna species due to the limits of information available (STECF 2009).",Stable,"This species is caught in relatively small quantities throughout its range. Reported worldwide landings range from 3,592 t in 1950, to 10,308 t in 2006, with a peak of over 26,000 t reported in 1983 and in 1990 (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>In the 1980s there was a marked increase in reported landings of all small tuna species combined compared to previous years, reaching a peak of about 139,412 t in 1988. Reported landings for the 1989–1995 period decreased to approximately 92,637 t, and since then values have oscillated, with a minimum of 69,895 t in 1993 and a maximum of 123,600 t in 2005. Declared catches were 79,228 t in 2006 and 74,087 t in 2007. A preliminary estimate of the total nominal landings of small tunas in 2008 is 55,876 t.

The species is subject to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing operations and is regularly caught in recreational fisheries. This species is also targeted by shark control programs in Australia (Paterson 1990, Reid&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently Reunion Island in the Western Indian Ocean. The species has been increasingly exploited by fisheries since the 1950s (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010) due to the increasing demand from the shark fin trade.&#160;Catches of Tiger Shark in directed shark fisheries  have been documented for a number of regions including the western  Atlantic (Hoey and Casey 1986, Berkeley and Campos 1988, Bonfil 1994,  Morgan<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009, Carlson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Brazil (Bonfil 1994), Australia (Stevens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Lyle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Tillett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Papua New Guinea (Kumoru 2013), Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014), Taiwan (Bonfil 1994), India (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015). <br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a common component of the U.S. east coast/Gulf of Mexico commercial shark bottom longline fishery, accounting for 8-36% of the catch (Morgan <em>et al. </em>2009, Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2012). The fishery catches mostly juvenile and subadult Tiger Sharks, although some larger sharks are also taken.&#160;In Australia, the Tiger Shark is targeted by commercial shark fisheries in northern New South Wales and in Western Australia. The species&#160;accounted for 3 tonne (t) and 5.9% of total catch of the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery in eastern Australia. However, catches by this fishery are probably smaller than landings from recreational fisheries in that same area (Park 2007, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In the Western Australia Tropical Shark Fishery, this shark was caught as a target species and annual catches averaged approximately 41 t between 2000 and 2004. This fishery was closed in late 2005 (Department of Fisheries 2005). The&#160;Tiger Shark is relatively common in the Indonesian shark fishery and contributed 5.2% of the total shark biomass of catches from between 2001 and 2006 (White 2007). The Tiger Shark is also commonly caught in the seamount gillnet and longline fishery off the west coast of India, where 242 t and 144 t of various shark species were taken during 2010 and 2011, respectively, but species-specific catches were not recorded (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;The Offshore Net and Line Fishery operating in the northern Australia catches the species incidentally (27 t in 2012), although mesh size is assumed to prevent capture of greater numbers (Lyle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1984, DPFI 2012). This shark is also taken in the Southern and Western Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery in Western Australia with a catch of 112 t reported in 2005-06 (McAuley 2008). The Tiger Shark is a bycatch in trawl fisheries although normally in small numbers and there are few records of catches for these fisheries. The Australian Commonwealth Trawl Sector reported a total catch for the species of 4.7 t from 2004-2011. The&#160;Tiger Shark is caught occasionally in the longline fisheries of Costa Rica (Dapp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), Mozambique (Sousa&#160;2012), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015) and by purse seiners in the Indian Ocean (Chassot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Although little species-specific catch data information is available for the Arabian Seas area, the high level of level of fishing pressure in the region is of concern with steep increases in both small-scale and industrial fishing effort between the 1990s and 2000s (PERSGA 2002, Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In tuna longline fisheries, the species is typically caught in small numbers relative to pelagic sharks and is often not reported. Between 2007 and 2013, an average of 54 t was landed annually by tuna longline boats regulated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT database, P. de Bruyn, pers. comm. 2015). Tiger Shark represented less than 10% of the total bycatch of all shark species in each of the management zones of the U.S. pelagic longline fishery (Mandelman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Panama longline fishery, the Tiger Shark represented 1.6% of shark catches of the estimated total catch of 109,500 t of various sharks since the mid-1980s (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Central and Western Pacific, the Tiger Shark is caught in low numbers (0.025 sharks per set; P. Williams, pers. comm. 2015) by tuna longline boats from most countries operating in that region. <br/>The Tiger shark is a common target of recreational fisheries in the United States, Australia, and South Africa. Approximately 96% of the catch in USA waters are released alive. In the New South Wales Gamefish Tournament, Tiger Shark catches were approximately 8 t per year between 1993 and 2005 (Park 2007). Recreational fishing may account for mortality in the Tiger Shark population in other countries, although catches are unmonitored.<br/><br/>Artisanal fisheries and IUU fisheries are also likely to be catching Tiger Shark, however information about landings from these fisheries is scarce as they remain mostly unmonitored. The Tiger Shark is commonly caught in artisanal fisheries in the tropics and subtropics, including in Mexico (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013), Panama (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014), Brazil (Bornatowski <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pimenta <em>et al</em>. 2014), and a few African countries (FAO 2014). In Bangladesh, landings of 4.5 t represent on average 1.36% of total catch (Jit <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is evidence that the species has been overfished by Indonesian fishing boats at Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Scott Reef in northern Australian waters. This area had been targeted by Indonesian fishermen since the 1800s but fishing was banned in 1988 and 2000, respectively (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in the region showed the absence of Tiger Shark at reefs historically fished despite years of protection whereas they were found present at nearby atolls that had been always protected from fishing (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species comprised 19% of the total shark biomass and 7.4% of total catch in numbers from Indonesian and Taiwanese IUU fishing vessels (Marshall 2011).<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a target species of shark control programs in Queensland (Paterson 1990, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and New South Wales, Australia (Reid et al. 2011), in South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently at Reunion Island. In Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) captured 4,757 Tiger Shark individuals between 1993 and 2010 (Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the species represented approximately 10 to 30% of total catch in the northern locations of the QSCP between 1964 and 2007 (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). Standardized catch rates from 1964-2007 for the QSCP in northern Queensland showed an increase in the relative importance of the Tiger Shark, from approximately 10 to 30% of total catch. This pattern is most likely due to the move in fishing gear from nets to drumlines (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). In southeast Australia, the Tiger Shark was commonly captured by the New South Wales Shark Meshing Program from 1950-2010 with approximately 30 sharks per year between 1950 and 2008, representing approximately 10% of the common shark species caught by the program in each of its locations (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). In South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program has caught approximately 50 individuals annually from 1978-2003. Since 1989, sharks caught alive are released; however, fishing mortality of the Tiger Shark in nets is 27% of captures (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). <br/><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span></span></span></span></p><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><p></p></span></span></span></span>","<p><span lang=""""EN-GB"""">There are no specific conservation or management measures in place for the Tiger Shark. However, there has been an increasing interest to intensify protection of the species in the Western North Atlantic. The current Fisheries Management Program for the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico includes quotas and fishing seasons to regulate catch of coastal shark species including the Tiger Shark (Carlson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). On the west and south coasts of Western Australia, a maximum size of 70 cm interdorsal length is applied for whaler sharks taken by recreational shark fishing, which includes the Tiger Shark. In Queensland, the maximum size allowed is 150 cm for all shark species and a possession limit of one shark of any species is imposed to recreational fishing. Similarly, in New South Wales, only one Tiger Shark can be taken per person per day. Some countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the Maldives), whereas others impose seasonal bans on shark fishing (Iran, the UAE) (Jabado and Spaet 2017).<br/></p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""""EN-GB""""><span lang=""""EN-GB"""">Long-term trends of catch rates of the Tiger Shark are available from regional shark control programs and United States fisheries observer programs. The species is not commonly caught in large numbers by most commercial fisheries and its catch is rarely recorded. Consequently, there is a lack of adequate data for stock assessment, definition of population structure, and documentation of global population trends for the Tiger Shark. </span><br/><br/>In the Western North Atlantic, data from observer surveys (1960-2000) from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center showed an upward trend of the relative abundance of the Tiger Shark with an increase of 6.7% per year since the 1980s. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) logbook data indicated a slow decline from 1986 to 2000 in Tiger Shark relative abundance (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). When logbook and observer data were combined, the relative abundance declined slightly then increased (Baum and Blachard 2010). The Shark Bottom Longline  Observer Program also showed an increase of 8% per year in Tiger Shark  relative abundance between 1994 and 2013. However, the Pelagic Observer  Program from the Southeast Fisheries Science Center showed no change in  abundance for the same period (J. Carlson, pers. comm<em>.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In northeast Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has used a combination of nets and drumlines to target large sharks since 1962 (Paterson 1990). The standardised catch rate of Tiger Sharks in northern Queensland increased until the 1980s and then decreased by the 2000s to approximately 66% of its original value. This trend in catch rate suggests a possible decline in the population between 1964 and 2007 (Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010). The CPUE of Tiger Sharks showed an overall declining trend for the QSCP between 1993 and 2010, with the most significant decline in southern Queensland (Holmes <em>et al. </em>2012). <span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">In southeast Australia, New South Wales has operated a netting program since 1937 (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011). The CPUE of Tiger Sharks showed marked fluctuations in the first four decades of records, and did not significantly change between 1950 and 2010, although a downward trend in CPUE was observed in the last two decades. The size frequency of Tiger Sharks caught by the program has changed over 60 years with a significant reduction in the proportion of large mature individuals being caught<span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">. The recent decline in catch rate and decrease in the proportion of large individuals suggests changes in the population structure and raises concern over the effects the program is having on the Tiger Shark population off New South Wales (Reid <em>et al</em><span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">. 2011). The  New South Wales game fishing tournaments reported a  decline in CPUE  from approximately 1.2 to 0.5 shark vessel/day  between 1993/94 and  2004/05, with fishers still targeting Tiger Sharks  during the tournaments, suggesting a decline in the population  (Park 2007).</span><br/><br/>In South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program has deployed large-mesh gillnets since 1952. There has been an annual increase of 3% in the CPUE of Tiger Sharks between 1978 and 2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006).&#160;This pattern seems comparable to the pattern observed in the first two decades of the Queensland Shark Control Program in northern Queensland.<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, a significant decrease in shark biomass, mainly carcharhinids, has been reported since the 1970s from trawl surveys and interviews with fishers (Valinassab <em>et al.</em> 2006, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015, Jabado and Spaet 2017). The Tiger Shark was formerly common in Eritrea and Iranian Gulf waters but interviews with fishermen have indicated large declines in landings (I. Elhassan unpubl. data, F. Owfi pers. comm. 06/02/2017). Surveys in the UAE have recorded a decline of approximately 90% in the landings of the Tiger Shark (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015, E. Grandcourt pers. comm. 06/02/2017) and the species has been absent from recent surveys in the Red Sea, where once it was reported to be common (Bonfil 2003, Kattan 2014, Spaet <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Pakistan and India, declines of 20-30% in the Tiger Shark have been recorded with an absence of individuals larger than 3 m in length in catches (M. Khan and Akhilesh K.V. pers. obs., Akhilesh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Tiger Shark is suspected to have undergone declines of at least 30-50% in the Arabian Sea over the last three generations (53 years) based on current levels of exploitation and the decline is likely to be ongoing and it was assessed as Vulnerable A2cd+3cd in the Arabian Seas region (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark has been shown to be at risk in the Arabian Seas region from fishing pressure, and from some shark control programs in other regions. The widespread distribution of this species increases the likelihood that it will survive increasing levels of exploitation in certain areas. Given the wide range of the species and the localities of the shark control programs, the Tiger Shark is suspected to have undergone an overall population reduction of close to 30% globally over the past three generations (53-68 years) based on actual levels of exploitation.&#160;<span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">A&#160;<span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">further population reduction is suspected over the future three generation lengths (2018-2086) based on current levels of exploitation that are likely to continue into the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""></span></span>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

In Togo, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Benin, both adults and juveniles are taken in the fishery year-around. In Togo, it is taken at depths ranging from eight to 20 meters, in the coastal zone within three nautical miles of the coast (FIRMS 2012-2013). As of 2004, the&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em> stock shared between Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia were also were also considered to be over-exploited (FIRMS 2000-2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Stocks of demersal fishes, including&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em>, which are available to artisanal fisheries were seriously depleted between 1984 and 1987, underwent a slight recovery between 1988 and 1991, and are still considered to be in a depressed state in Nigeria (Moses 2000). <em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is also taken as by-catch in the commercial octopus fishery operating off the coast of Guinea (FIRMS 2012-2013).&#160;The best model (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin) was considered to be overexploited with an Bcurrent/B0.1 of 825%, and Fcurrent/F0.1 is 20%.<br/><strong><br/></strong>Mangroves are an important habitat for larval and juvenile <em>G. decadactylus. </em>In Nigeria,<em>&#160;</em>large tracts of mangrove are being lost through oil pollution, felling by local communities for fuelwood and building materials and clearing by the oil companies to make way for well location, oil pipelines and flow stations. Additionally, the exotic palm <em>Nypa fruticans</em> is rapidly replacing native mangroves (Moses 2000).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><u><br/></u>Additionally, the targeting of juvenile fishes and by-catch of finfish from shrimp trawls are serious management problems in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone, and this is likely the case in other parts of West Africa (Baio 2010). <br/><br/>This species used to be abundant, but is now considered uncommon in many parts of its range.&#160;In Ghana, it is reported in mixed-species Threadfin catch and in 2009 combined threatfin species catch in artisanal species 1,857 tonnes.

Total landings of <em>G. decadactylus</em> have increased continually, with minor fluctuations, from 1950 to the present. In 2011, the total catch for this species was&#160;18,557 tonnes. In the last 10 years, landings have increased by 8%.<br/><br/>The abundance of&#160;<em>G. decadactylus&#160;</em>varies seasonally by depth. The species is more abundant in the dry season in coastal zones at depths ranging from 5-15 meters, and at depths of 15-40 m during the wet season (Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><br/><u>Model stock assessments</u><br/>In Guinea, annual catches of <em>G. decadactylus </em>increased from 992 tonnes to 1,824 tonnes over the time span of 1995 to 1999, with the large majority of catches&#160;coming&#160;from the industrial rather than the artisanal fishery. Depending on the model used and the location, global evaluations of the stock based on catch/effort/abundance information was considered fully exploited or overexploited by the end of the time series (calculated value of mf<sub> </sub>MSY&#160;=0.9 or 1.4 in Guinea; 0.4 in Senegal, 0.6 or 1.4 in Cape Verde). Annual indices of abundance have&#160;deceased&#160;from 1985 to 1994 in Guinea. Fishing effort, which was calculated as the ratio of captures over indices of abundance, have increased from 1985 (0.35) to 1999 (7.04). A rapid depletion (70% decline) of biomass of five indicator species (including<em> G. decadactylus</em>,<em> Pseudotolithus elongatus</em>, <em>Pseudotolighus typus</em>, <em>Pseudotolightus senegalensis</em>&#160;and <em>Arius </em>spp.) was seen&#160;corresponding&#160;to increasing effort (doubling every three years in&#160;Guinea; Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> was found to be low in relative abundance in beach seine landings taken in various coastal locations off central Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn and Sackey-Mensah 2012). Artisanal fishery production of <em>G. decadactylus</em> has increased from 2002-2006, with a 2,500.2% increase in production from 39.5 tonnes to 425.4 tonnes from 2002-2004, and a 87.8% increase in production from 1,025.8-1,926.0 from 2004-2006 (Baio 2010).<br/><br/><u>Trends in demersal fisheries off the continental shelf of Mauritania<br/></u>The fisheries of the northwestern African continental shelf have developed over the past several decades from low levels of fishing to intense exploitation, leading to severe decreases in biomass and serious signs of over-exploitation. In general, the abundance of demersal resources of northwest Africa has declined by a factor of four over the past 20 to 30 years. Although this species is not a component of fisheries in Mauritania, many trends in Mauritania are reflective of those in Senegal and Guinea. Over the Mauritanian continental shelf, reductions in biomass of up to 75% have been recorded. Using data from scientific surveys conducted in Mauritanian waters, trends in species biomass were&#160;modelled&#160;for 24 taxa, 15 of which showed significant decreasing trends, and only one of which showed increases in abundance. In Senegal and Guinea, abundance indices for this species have remained low, with shallow declines from 1985-1999 (Gascuel<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, CPUE for this species from 1990 to 2010 is fluctuating but relatively stable (Williams pers. comm. 2013). Length at age one is 18 cm, age two is 23 cm, age three is 27, and length&#160;infinity&#160;is 54 cm in Nigeria (Abohweyere 1989).<br/>In the ISTAM database from 1965 to 1998, mean sizes have decreased from 0.4 kg to around 0.1-0.2 kg in 1998.<br/><br/>From 1985-1995, based on indices of abundance, this species declined and then started to increase until 2002 (Sidibe pers comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Mauritania, from 2000 -2001, landings from scientific surveys are fluctuating from 29 metric tonnes in 2000 to a high of 93 metric tonnes in 2008, and a decline to 10 metric tonnes in 2011 (Camara pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Senegal, there has been no observed decrease in juveniles in studies since 2003 (Morais pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Ghana, this species is very scarce in markets, and it used to be more abundant. &#160;However, it is still considered common in Senegal and Nigeria. &#160;It is not that abundant in markets in&#160;Mauritania.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th
Galeorhinus galeus,VU,31856.42393,51733805.13,1623.967751,1523.5673227472696,39352,10212764,2006-01-31,Global,CHORDATA,CARCHARHINIFORMES,CHONDRICHTHYES,TRIAKIDAE,A2bd+3d+4bd,"<em>G. galeus</em> has a long history of exploitation in target fisheries in most parts of its range where the species has been in demand for liver-oil, meat and fins. The main threat to the various populations of <em>G. galeus</em> is from targeting widely with gillnets and longlines. Minor threats include fishing with trawls and other methods. There is accidental capture of pups on nursery grounds in gillnets of small mesh-size and recreational fishers operating in inshore shallow-water areas. Habitat degradation in potential nursery areas due to development and siltation may also negatively affect recruitment to populations of this species.  Other threats are habitat degradation by the effects of trawling through disturbance of substrates (Walker 1998) and installation of high voltage direct current sub-sea cables with induced magnetic and electric fields across their migration lanes (Walker 2001). <br/> <br/><strong>Australasia</strong> <br/>In south-eastern Australia, the harvest of <em>G. galeus</em> began in the mid-1920s, but increased markedly during the war years with the market for shark liver oil. Catches levelled off at about 2,000 t live weight during 1949 to 1957 with the decline of the liver market and as the fishery spread from inshore to offshore waters (Olsen 1959). Establishment of the shark meat market and the introduction of gillnets in 1964, production rose rapidly to peak during 1969 at 3,158 t. Following a ban on the sale of large school sharks in 1972 because of high mercury levels, catches declined for about 10 years. With relaxation of the mercury laws catches again increased, reaching 3,060 t during 1986. Since 1986, the total annual catch from the Southern Shark Fishery had declined to 172 t by 2001 (Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2002). The mature biomass has been estimated from age-based model outputs to be below 20% of the level before commercial target fishing began (Punt <em>et al</em>. 2000). <br/> <br/>In New Zealand, <em>G. galeus</em> have been exploited since the mid-1940s. With the demise of the liver oil fishery in the 1950s, a market for the meat developed (some is exported to Australia) and catches peaked at 5,000 t live weight in 1984 (Francis 1998, Paul and Sanders 2001). Catch levels have been ~3,000 t for the past decade, but it is not known if this, or the current commercial TACs (3,107 t), are sustainable, or if they are at levels that will allow the stocks to move towards a size that will support the maximum sustainable yield. <br/> <br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong> <br/>In this region mean annual individual fecundity is only seven pups, age at first breeding is about 13 years in both sexes, and natural mortality rate is low as evidenced from the longevity of 40 years (Peres and Vooren 1991, Ferreira and Vooren 1991). These parameter values characterize the species as susceptible to recuitment overfishing. In Uruguay the species was fished intensively in the 1940s for liver oil. The southwestern Atlantic population of the species has been subject to intensive fishing in its entire area of distribution since about 1985. Statistics of the fishery CPUE in south Brazil and Uruguay are evidence that as a result of intensive fishing from 1985 the abundance of the species had decreased by 85% in 1997, and the fishery in this region continues without restraint (Miranda and Vooren 2003). Since 1995 the species has disappeared in the coastal fishery off Uruguay (A. Domingo unpublished data). The species migrates seasonally between wintering grounds in south Brazil and Uruguay and summer grounds off Argentina where the pupping and nursery areas are situated, where intense and directed fishery of gravid females occurs and where critical habitat is known to have been lost (e.g., Bahía Blanca and El Rincón). Yields in Argentina dropped sharply after intensive fishing and high landings in the years 1988 to 1992 (Chiaramonte 1998). Since then declines have continued. The declared landings for """"sharks+cazón"""" in the SAGyP statistics (the national authority for fisheries in Argentina), and in which <em>G. galeus</em> comprises most of these landings, show overall declines of over 80% between 1992 (4,012 t) and 2004 (757 t), with landings around 1,000t or less since 2000, yet in the mid-1980s the landings were &gt;5,000 t. These declines are attributed to recruitment overfishing and if the fishery continues, the population will very likely be extirpated. Despite this, in the late 1990s new access to the fishery was granted to a large number of artisanal fishermen (at present around 700 are registered in Buenos Aires province), and no management is in place. <br/> <br/><strong>South Africa</strong> <br/>In South Africa <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em> is targeted (mainly when catches from other non-elasmobranch fisheries are low) in longline and handline fisheries and taken incidentally in artisanal and recreational fisheries. In 2003, 23 permits were issued to shark fishermen, however no seasonal/temporal restrictions have been placed on the fishery nor on number or size of <em>G. galeus</em> landed. Kroese and Sauer (1998) determined that the landed catch of soupfin shark between 1992 and 1994 reached a peak of 48 t (1994, dressed carcass weight) and a minimum of 5.2 t in 1993. Anecdotal evidence suggests that CPUE of soupfin sharks has declined in the last 15 years (G. Kingma, soupfin shark longline fishermen, Hout Bay, Western Province, pers. comm. February, 2003) and data from the South African Shark Management Plan (MCM 2002) indicates that the annual commercial linefish catch of soupfin shark has significantly declined, from a peak of 249 t in 1992 to 71 t in 1999. It is unclear whether this is due to a change in target species, change in effort, or change in the population size. According to Freer (1992), 41.6% of total catch by mass in the Gansbaai longline fishery is female, 87.4% of which are immature females. This indicates that a relatively high number of immature females are being extracted from the population, thereby possibly influencing future recruitment (Freer 1992). Similar to other populations of soupfin shark, those in South Africa segregate according to sex and size. This combined with life-history parameters make these sharks vulnerable to over-exploitation. There are indications that the South African population is currently being fully exploited and any increase in fishing pressure may result in a decline of biomass to below 40% of the pre-exploitation condition (McCord 2005). <br/> <br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong> <br/>Tope is of limited commercial importance in commercial fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic where it is typically a bycatch of mixed demersal and pelagic fisheries, especially French vessels fishing in the English Channel, Western Approaches and northern Bay of Biscay. Data is apparently limited, as landings data are often included as """"dogfishes and hounds"""". Nevertheless, England and France have species-specific landings data and there are limited data from Denmark and Ireland in recent years (ICES 2004). France appears to target tope, and reported landings of approximately 350 to 500 t/year during the 1990s (landings were higher in 1987 at 600 t, some 6% of the total shark catches, with tope ranking third behind spurdog and lesser spotted dogfish). Tope also feature in catch statistics for Portugal Mainland and in the Azores. In the Azores this species is a bycatch of the demersal longline fishery. Biological data for Northeast Atlantic stocks are limited (SGRST 2002). <br/> <br/>Tope is important in recreational fisheries with some anglers specializing in tope catching. Recently, a newspaper article (Fishing News, June 17th 2005) urged English North Sea fishermen to target tope for meat and for the fin trade out of Lowestoft, East Anglia. This has raised cause for concern, including among the recreational fishers (see www.sharktrust.org for further details). The value of this species for recreational angling on the south coast of England (and presumably elsewhere off the UK) is high. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong> <br/>Although no direct fisheries for <em>G. galeus</em> exist in the Mediterranean, it was traditionally caught as bycatch in gillnets and trammel nets in the Northern Adriatic Sea, also as bycatch of semi-industrial (Adriatic Sea and Sicily) and artisanal fisheries in pelagic and demersal nets, deep longlines, drift lines and troll lines (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 1987). A small directed gillnet fishery targeting <em>Mustelus</em> spp. and <em>Squalus</em> spp. operated off the Balearic Islands in the past which reported catches of <em>G. galeus</em>. In recent times, only bottom trawl and longline fisheries have reported continuous bycatch of <em>G. galeus</em>, and such reports are very rare nowadays. The development of the bottom trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean over the first half of the 20th century in the northern range, and during the latter half in the southern range, is considered as one of the principal factors responsible of the decline of many demersal elasmobranch species. In this sense, both overfishing and habitat degradation must be considered as factors potentially responsible for declines. The analysis of the Medits trawl survey data from 1994-1999 shows a very low frequency of occurrence for <em>G. galeus</em> in the Mediterranean (only five positive hauls or 0.05 %), although it should be noted that trawling is a minor threat to this species and numbers in trawl surveys would not be expected to be high. Its overall biomass was estimated to be 0.2 kg/km² for the Mediterranean. The standing stock biomass was estimated at 126 t (0.23%) (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Off Italy, Relini <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported the capture of <em>G. galeus</em> in only one of the 11 zones studied as part of the Italian national project (9,281 hauls in total, around the Italian coast, from 1985-1998), although data on biomass for this species were not provided. Tuna trap data from the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea from 1898 to 1992 shows a dramatic decrease in the abundance of <em>G. galeus</em> catches (80 individuals between 1898 and 1905; only eight for the 1906 to 1913 period and 0 from 1914 to 1922) (Vacchi <em>et al</em>. 2002). Thus, these data can perhaps be interpreted as an indication of early depletion of the population at least in shallow waters in this area, which could also have occurred in other Mediterranean areas where similar practices historically operated. Data from the Medits survey for the Adriatic Sea were compared with those from the survey Hvar, carried out in 1948 (Jukic-Peladic 2001). Although no data on individual species captured biomass are reported, <em>G. galeus</em> appeared in the 1948 survey, but not in the Medits survey. Data on elasmobranch landings from the long-line fleet at the Palma de Mallorca (Balearic Islands) central fish auction wharf reported only one specimen in 1996 (B. Reviriego pers.comm.), six in 1999 (G. Morey pers.comm.) and recent regular visits have reported no further specimens. In addition, <em>G. galeus</em> was not specifically reported in the official landing statistics, since it did not appear in the 1999 to 2001 period, thus furthering the difficulties in monitoring of the population. For the Spanish long-line fleet off the Levantine coast, operating mainly in the Alboran Sea and around the Balearic Islands, the observed catch rate (as bycatch) of <em>G. galeus</em> is about five specimens per ship and year (D. Macías pers.comm.) In Tunisian waters, where there exists a lower fishing pressure than off the northern Mediterranean coasts, the species is considered to be very rare (Bradai 2000). <br/> <br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong> <br/>In the Northeast Pacific the shark fishery off California rapidly expanded during the 1930s due to the demand for liver-oil. Catches increased, peaking at 4,185 t in 1939 with around 75 to 80% of the catch being <em>G. galeus</em> and prices for the liver-oil rose from some US$50/t in 1937 to US$2,000/t in 1941 (Ripley 1946). While the fishery was intensive and expanded rapidly it only lasted eight years, during which CPUE was reported to decline dramatically. Although the fishery collapsed in the 1940s (due primarily to the synthetic production of Vitamin A) it seems unlikely that the stock itself collapsed. Only the large animals were being targeted, with 10-inch mesh size, fishermen were not interested in catching the young animals, which had lower grade Vitamin A in the liver oil. Therefore while it appeared that the adult stock might have collapsed there would have been large stocks of juveniles to allow for a population recovery. Since the 1940s given the low price for soupfin shark and low interest in the meat there has been no economic incentive to target it, and it is now caught at low levels as bycatch with bottom and pelagic gillnets, bottom and pelagic longlines, bottom and pelagic trawls, and with hook-and-line. (Ripley 1946, Ebert 2003, Compagno in prep b). Thus although there has been no stock assessment for over 50 years, the fishing mortality can be expected to be low. Cailliet <em>et al</em>. (1992) reported the fishery over the past several decades had remained fairly steady, even declining due to increasing fishing restrictions.","Outside Australia and New Zealand there are no, or few, regulations established for populations of <em>G.galeus</em>, see Walker (1999) for a fairly recent review. However, there is increasing international recognition of the threats facing this species. At the CITES Conference of the Parties (CoP) 13 held in 2004, the CITES Animals Committee had a specific recommendation regarding <em>G. galeus</em>. The following text is taken from CoP13 Doc. 35, Annex 2 (<a href=""""www.cites.org"""">CITES</a>): <em>G. galeus</em> are valued for their meat and fins and are (or have been) important in target and multispecies fisheries in temperate waters world-wide. Most stocks are shared between several range States, and in most regions are seriously depleted. Only a small number of States have achieved successful management of this biologically-vulnerable species. The Animals Committee recommends that range States request FAO's assistance with developing a capacity building workshop for this species in order to train managers from developing States and other States where coastal shark fisheries are not being managed. This would also serve as a case study for the management of other coastal shark fisheries. <br/> <br/>In addition, CITES CoP13, Decision 13.42 directed to Parties states that Parties """"should take note of the species-specific recommendations in document CoP13 Doc. 35 Annex 2 with a view to ensuring that international trade is not detrimental to the status of these species."""" This includes <em>G. galeus</em>. <br/> <br/>See Walker (1999) for a fairly recent and thorough review of relevant management measures, some updates are provided below: <br/> <br/><strong>Australasia</strong> <br/>Management measures in the fishery of southern Australia where the stock is most depleted include limited entry for the use of gillnets and longlines (since 1984) and, for all fishing sectors, TAC (since 2000). Input controls include limits on length of net (since 1988), various 4 to 6 week closed seasons to protect pregnant animals of <em>G. galeus</em> during October to December (1953 to 1967 and 1993 to 1994), and a legal minimum mesh-size of six inches for gillnets (since 1975) for most of the fished area. Closed areas to commercial gillnetting in inshore waters of Tasmania have been variously implemented since 1954 to protect newborn, juvenile and pregnant <em>G. galeus</em> on nursery areas. A more extensive closed area was adopted during 1988 when all Victoria proclaimed waters (inside three-mile limit) were closed to the use of shark gillnets and longlines. Legal minimum lengths were phased in by the States and Commonwealth during 1949 and the early 1950s and remain current. During 2002, the TAC for <em>G. galeus</em> was 269 t for the Southern Shark Fishery, 33 t for the South East Trawl Fishery, and 2 t for the Great Australia Bight Trawl Fishery. <br/> <br/>In New Zealand, minimum mesh-sizes of 125 mm and 150 mm apply for <em>G. galeus</em> in northern New Zealand and southern New Zealand, respectively. Numerous general restrictions apply to the use of commercial and recreational gillnets and longlines, including limits on the length of gillnets, number of hooks per longline, number of longlines, soak time, the amount of an estuary or bay that can be blocked by a gillnet, and areas that can be fished. The restrictions vary regionally and are designed to reduce the number of nets lost and the amount of fish wasted to sea lice and decay because of excessively long sets, and to minimise conflict with other users of inshore waters. Also, <em>G. galeus</em> is covered by the mixed species daily bag limits for recreational fishers of 20 and 30 fish for the northern and central regions and southern region of New Zealand, respectively. In October 1986, the commercial TAC was set at 2,590 t, but this had increased to 3,107 t by 1995 to 1996 (as a consequence of quota appeals, not stock assessment) and was current in 2003. The commercial TAC was exceeded by up to 10% in the late 1990s. <br/> <br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong> <br/>In the El Rincon area of Argentina where gravid females occur, a restriction has been established for the fishing fleet during the months in which these sharks approach the shore (A. Massa pers. comm). No other conservation or management measures are in place for this species. A ban on fishing <em>G. galeus</em> is recommended at the regional level involving Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. <br/> <br/><strong>South Africa</strong> <br/>There are no conservation measures in place at present. Proposed policy for 2005 indicates that long-term rights for the elasmobranch fishery will be allocated and multi-species permits will be revoked and replaced with single-species permits. It is envisaged that only six demersal longline permits will be issued to target soupfin sharks. The number of traditional handline vessels permitted to catch traditional linefish (including sharks) will also be restricted in terms of numbers. This will alter the characteristics of the fishery and it is highly recommended that another stock assessment be completed within 3-5 years to evaluate the effect of the aforementioned changes on the population. McCord (2005) made several management recommendations for the period 2005-2010 including restrictive licensing, size restrictions and seasonal/area closures. <br/> <br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong> <br/>There are no conservation measures in place currently other than in California, gillnets are prohibited in State waters, although gear regulations do not apply specifically to <em>G.galeus</em> here or in other areas of its Eastern North Pacific range. The status of the population is unknown, and this species hasn't been intensively studied for over 50 years. The situation needs to be studied in detail in terms of stock assessment and biological parameters (e.g., age and growth has never been studied for the species in this region), and this assessment revisited when more information is available.",Decreasing,"This species makes extensive migrations, for example, animals tagged in the United Kingdom showing mixing throughout their Northeast Atlantic distribution and being recaptured as far away as to the north of Iceland (2,461 km), the Canary Islands (2,526 km) and the Azores (1,610 km off the coast of Portugal) (Fitzmaurice 1979, Holden and Horrod 1979, Stevens 1990). In Australia, tagging has shown mixing across most of the southern half of the continent (with movements of up to 1,260 km) and a number of animals have moved across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand (Olsen 1984, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>Spatial and temporal variations in size structure and sex ratio are apparent for various populations of <em>G. galeus</em> (see Walker 1999), which have implications for management. The species appears to have fairly discrete pupping and nursery areas, which are often in shallow, protected bays and estuaries (Olsen 1954).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Australasia</strong>
<br/>Inshore waters of Victoria and Tasmania include nursery areas for this species. Olsen (1959,1984) reported a decline in abundance of juveniles in two Tasmanian nursery areas sampled regularly over a five-year period. He attributed this decline to fishing pressure on pregnant females during their pupping migration and to intensified fishing of juveniles in inshore areas such as Port Phillip Bay during the period 1940 to 50. In Port Phillip Bay during 1943 to 1945, 60,000 juveniles averaging 0.9 kg in weight were caught annually. A continuation of this nursery area sampling during the 1990s (Stevens and West 1997) indicated a substantial further reduction in abundance of school shark pups and small juveniles in Tasmanian and Victorian embayments and estuaries. Since the abundance of pups sampled in these areas seems insufficient to account for the current adult stock size it is likely that other pupping areas exist, either outside Victoria and Tasmania, or more likely, close inshore along ocean beach coastlines. In New Zealand inshore embayments such as Kaipara Harbour are nursery areas for this species (Walker 1999).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong>
<br/>The southwest Atlantic population of <em>G. galeus</em> migrates seasonally between wintering grounds off south Brazil and Uruguay, and summer grounds off Argentina where the pupping and nursery areas are situated.
<br/>
<br/>In the wintering area off south Brazil the species occurs from April to November, south of latitude 33°S over smooth bottom at depths of 40 to 330 m (Vooren 1997). Only large juveniles (mostly with TL from about 70 cm onwards) and adults of both sexes migrate in winter to south Brazil, where at that time the gravid females concentrate during the final phase of gestation and where the non-gravid adult females copulate in a specific area on the upper continental slope (Peres and Vooren 1991, Ferreira and Vooren 1991). Birth does not occur in south Brazil.
<br/>
<br/>In Argentina the commercial fishery operates inshore at depths of 18 to 57 m, from September to December off Buenos Aires Province, then in January and February in northern Patagonia, then in March-April again off Buenos Aires (Chiaramonte 1998, Elías <em>et al</em>. 2004). These periods correspond with the months of departure and arrival of the species in south Brazil. It is inferred that the age groups older than about five years of the population as a whole migrate between Argentina and south Brazil, and that the nursery grounds are situated in Argentine waters and in some cases are where critical habitat is known to have been lost (e.g., Bahía Blanca and El Rincón).
<br/>
<br/><strong>South Africa</strong>
<br/>Little is known about the movements of the South African population of <em>G. galeus</em> (Freer 1992). Seasonal differences exist in catch composition, females comprise the majority of the catch (~90%) from December to January and males comprise close to 100% of the catch between April and September (Freer 1992, M. Kroese pers. comm. 2003). Catch records from the RV Sardinops and RV Africana indicate that midsummer (December) catches are dominated by pregnant females (Freer 1992). Individuals have been caught up to depths exceeding 400 m, although they are most frequently caught between 55 to 150 m (McCord 2005). It is thought that female <em>G. galeus</em> give birth in lagoons and estuaries along the west coast of South Africa (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989), and although no nursery areas have been conclusively identified, Freer (1992) suggests shallow embayments such as Struis, St.Helena, Walker and False Bays, and data from the Gansbaai longline fishery with a high proportion of the catch being immature females may also be a nursery area for this species (M. McCord pers. comm).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>
<br/>Little is known regarding critical habitats but nursery areas may occur off Portugal and around the Canary Islands (Munoz-Chapuli 1984), and possibly in the Bristol Channel, UK (see Walker 1999 for further details).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong>
<br/>In the eastern North Pacific, young and immature sharks are caught off Ventura Flats, San Francisco Bay, Monterey and Tomales Bay. Southern California below Point Conception (especially Ventura Flats, east of Santa Barbara) is an important <em>G. galeus</em> nursery ground, with considerable numbers of adult females and newborns being found there in the spring.  They are known to segregate by sex and size. South of Point Conception, adult males tend to be found further offshore in deeper water (>20 m), while females are in usually found in shallower water (<15 m). The proportion of large mature males is highest in northern California, while mature females are most abundant in southern California. North of Point Conception there is a greater proportion of smaller immature females, but in central California the sex ratio is about even (Ripley 1946, Ebert 2001, 2003). They are highly migratory, moving north during the summer and south during the winter or into deeper waters. They are swift moving and can travel up to 34 miles per day and have been reported to travel at a sustained rate of 10 miles per day for up to 100 days. One shark tagged off Ventura in southern California was captured 26 months later off Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Another shark was tagged in San Francisco Bay and recaptured 12 months later in the same location.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

It is generally discarded, but is retained and utilised in some areas.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>Although a large portion of the population of <em>G. melastomus</em> avoided most of the commercial fishing pressure associated with the 1970s deepwater trawl fishery for Blue Ling (<em>Molva dypterygia</em>) in the northeast Atlantic at &gt;600 m, it is concerning to note that mature individuals of this species are found at similar depths to the shallowest depth range of this fishery, and that commercial deepwater trawl vessels are now targeting these sharks. The targeting of mature individuals of this species may lead to similar detrimental impacts experienced by other deepwater species in this area (Crozier 2003).<br/><br/>Off the south coast of Portugal (Algarve), this species is captured in high quantities as bycatch of the bottom trawl fishery that targets the Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>), Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and Deepwater Pink Shrimp (<em>Parapenaeus longirostris</em>), and by the near bottom longline fishery that targets European Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>), Conger Eels (<em>Conger conger</em>) and Wreck Fish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>). In both fisheries, most captured specimens are discarded (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2005). Most specimens are captured and returned to the sea alive, but usually with severe injuries (due to the long trawling periods or hooks) that are likely to impair their survival. However, declines in traditional target species during the last few years mean it is likely that fisherman are now landing larger quantities of “alternative” species, such as this catshark, so it may be increasingly retained and sold.<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>The species is caught as bycatch by trawl nets and bottom longlines on slope bottoms. The species appears to suffer greater fishing mortality in the Ionian, south Adriatic and Aegean Seas, compared to along the coasts of Morocco, Spain, France and around Crete. Length Frequency Distributions (LFD) show that along the coasts of Morocco, Spain, France and around Crete specimens were mostly larger than 30 cm (78% of the total), while only 23% of the specimens around the coasts of Corsica, Sicily and in the Ionian, South Adriatic and Aegean Seas were over 30 cm (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>It seems that this species suffers relatively moderate effects from fishing pressure in the south Ligurian and northern Tyrrhenian sea, although it is an important bycatch of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishery.<br/><br/><em>G. melastomus</em> constitutes a significant portion of the bycatch of the Viareggio fleet’s fishing efforts, but most of the individuals are discarded due to the limited market demand and low commercial value. Only a fraction of the larger individuals (TL&gt;40 cm) are landed at Viareggio (about 700 kg in 2002) (Abella and Serena 2005). Considering the depths at which <em>G. melastomus</em> is caught (250–800 m) and the observed poor condition of the individuals immediately after their capture, it is likely that only a small fraction of the discarded individuals survive. However, it should be noted that the fishing grounds for the Viareggio fleet coincide only partially with the areas where <em>G. melastomus</em> is known to be abundant, and that higher densities of this species are found in deep waters off northern Corsica, where the fishing pressure is moderate. These areas could therefore act as a refuge for this species (Abella and Serena 2005).<br/><br/>In the Alboran Sea, where this species is very abundant, <em>G. melastomus</em> is the most important bycatch species in the recently developed bottom trawl fishery targeting the Deepwater Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) (Torres <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>The recently developed ban on bottom trawling below depths of 1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea probably offers this species some refuge from fishing pressure.","No species-specific actions are in place for this species. The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of 1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in February 2005 (<a href=""""http://www.gfcm.org/gfcm/topic/16100/en"""">recommendation GFCM/2005/1 on the management of certain fisheries exploiting demersal and deepwater species</a>) and this came into force in September 2005. <br/><br/>In European Commission waters, a combined TAC is set for a group of deep-water sharks, which includes <em>G. melastomus</em>. In 2007, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for deepwater sharks (including this species) in ICES Sub-areas V, VI, VII, VIII and IX was 2,472 t (ICES 2007). In 2008, the TAC for these species in these areas was reduced to 1,646 t. In 2007 and 2008, the TAC for deepwater sharks was set at 20 t annually in Sub-area X, and 99 t in Sub-area XII (ICES 2007).",Stable,"<strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>This species segregates by size and sex, with small, immature sharks generally found at depths of less than 500 m (P. Crozier pers. comm.). Norwegian exploratory fishery surveys found this species between depths of 500–1,000 m, where CPUE peaked at 750 m, with a catch rate of 140 kg/1,000 hooks (N-R. Hareide pers. comm.).<br/><br/>This species was one of the most abundant elasmobranchs recorded in the Norwegian Sea according to fishery-independent Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Surveys of the north Norwegian Coast, from 1992–2005 (ICES 2007). The total catch during these years was 8,376 individuals, with annual catch fluctuating widely between 26 and 1,883 individuals per year (averaging a catch rate of 644.3 over all years) (ICES 2007).<br/><br/>Data obtained aboard commercial longline vessels operating off southern Portugal (Algarve) from 1997 and 1998 (Erzini <em>et al</em>. 1999) compared to 2003 (Coelho <em>et al|</em>. 2005) show an increase of 151% in CPUE Official fisheries landings statistics for this species in the Algarve show an increase in landings of 48% during the last decade (DGPA 1988–2001). It should be noted this increase refers only to commercial landings and not actual captures. This increase may be due to a reduction in discards of this species, since a decline in stocks of traditional target species has resulted in increased retention of this species. Despite this, off southern Portugal the population appears to be stable currently.<br/><br/>This species is very abundant in the northern area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, especially in the Reykjanes Ridge (southwest of Iceland) where the CPUE can be as high as 58.5 kg/1,000 hooks (Hareide and Garnes 2001). It is also very abundant on the Hatton Bank, northwest of Ireland (Hareide unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>This species is apparently relatively common in the Mediterranean Sea. It occurred in 1,702 of 6,336 tows during MEDITS research trawl surveys conducted throughout the northern Mediterranean from 1994–1999 (Alboran to the Aegean Sea, at depths of 10–800 m) (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Data from the MEDITS bottom trawl surveys revealed high occurrence (&gt;5% of the hauls) and abundance (&gt;10 kg/km² or &gt;10% of relative biomass) of <em>G. melastomus</em> (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005). Abundance was consistently &gt;100 kg/km² in the Gulf of Lions and in Sardinian waters, with a maximum of 1,040 kg/km² recorded from the Alboran Sea. From estimates of the total biomass, 40% of the Mediterranean stock was found to occur in the Alboran Sea (2,600 t). Elsewhere, the only significant stocks (300–400 t) were in the central Tyrrhenian (off Corsica) and the Sicilian Channel (Serena 2005). In the Alboran Sea, maximum indices, obtained in 1997 and 2002, indicated no specific trend in abundance, whereas the biomass showed a slightly decreasing trend from 1994 (Rey <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><em>G. melastomus</em> is very abundant off eastern Spain. CPUE from trawl surveys conducted in the Gulf of Valencia during 1988–1990 captured between 27 and 250 specimens per five hour trawl (Guallart 1990).<br/><br/>Monthly landings data from Viareggio harbour (Italy) from 1990–2001 and trawl surveys (GRUND project) from 1985–2001 (Relini and Piccinetti 1996) suggest a decreasing trend in abundance (expressed as catch in kg/hr), especially over the last three years. However, no robust statistical analysis of the time series was possible due to variability and a lack of data series (Abella and Serena 2005).<br/><br/>Comparable trawl surveys conducted in the Adriatic Sea in 1948 and1998 showed no significant difference in the abundance of this species on the slope (Jukić-Peladić <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>MEDITS survey data presented by Bertrand <em>et al</em>. (2000) showed no apparent trend in density indices between the years, although in some parts of the Mediterranean basin (Tyrrhenian Sea) <em>G. melastomus</em> showed a slight increasing trend and some seasonal fluctuations in biomass, with a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer (Baino and Serena 2000).Data from surveys suggests that juveniles occur in shallower waters, and adults at greater depths. For example, specimens captured at depths of 201–500 m in the Alboran Sea were generally all smaller than 20 cm (although they were also recorded at 501–800 m), whereas specimens larger than 20 cm were generally restricted to the 501–800 m range (Rey <em>et al</em>. 2004). Specimens captured by deep trawl nets (&gt;800 m) tend to be of a larger mean size (Ungaro <em>et al</em>. 2001, Massutì and Moranta 2002), similar to results obtained from bottom longline catches (Carasson <em>et al</em>. 1992, Ungaro <em>et al</em>. 1999). High concentrations of juveniles have also been observed in the Alboran Sea, Sardinian waters and southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

This strong decline in abundance is attributed to intense trawl fishing all year round in coastal waters. The catches in 2005 were of small juveniles, which is evidence that reproduction still takes place in that area (Klippel <em>et al. </em>2005, Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005). Intense coastal fishing pressure is continuing throughout its coastal range and the threat is ongoing. The exposure of its coastal habitat to fisheries and its vulnerable life-history characteristics provide little capacity for recovery. <br/> <br/>Coastal fishing pressure is also known to be intense in Argentina, at the southern limit of this species' distribution. This species has occasionally been reported in catches along the coast of Argentina from Rio de la Plata to Quequén and has been reported as irregular in the demersal catches at Mar del Plata (Menni and Stehmann 2000). Batoids are an important resource in most demersal trawl fisheries in Argentina (Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006). A coastal multispecies demersal trawl fishery operates out off Quequén (38°37'S, 58°50'S), in which bycatch of batoids fluctuates seasonally between 44.5% and 67.5% of total catch (Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006). This species was not reported in a recent study of the bycatch of this fishery (Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006), and a lack of historical information prevents a comparison of temporal trends. <br/> <br/>The disappearance of this species from beach-seine catches in southern Brazil 2002 to 2003, where it was previously captured, and the decline of 99% in abundance since 1982 observed in those coastal waters warrant an assessment of Critically Endangered. Fishing pressure is intense throughout its range and it is likely that similar declines have occurred in areas where data are lacking. <br/> <br/><strong>USA</strong> <br/>This species is rarely taken as bycatch and is not commercially targeted in U.S. waters. Data sets from the coastal bottom longline shark fishery, the drift gillnet fishery, and fishery independent sampling (longline) by Virginia Institute of Marine Biology (VIMS) all show very low catch rates and no population trends are evident (Burgess <em>et al. </em>unpublished data, Carlson pers. comm., Musick <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). The occurrence of <em>G. altavela</em> appears to be habitat dependent, with all of the VIMS specimens caught at one station. This may explain its low abundance. It has a relatively wide occurrence on the US eastern seaboard and is only a minimal capture in fisheries in this region. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong> <br/>Historically this species was not uncommon in the catch of demersal fisheries (trawl and set nets) throughout the Mediterranean and the southern shores in particular. In the 1980s it was quite frequently captured in the Sicilian Channel and landed in Mazzara del Vallo (Trapani, Sicily), but now it is absent from the local catch record (M. Vacchi pers. comm). There are no records of <em>G. altavela</em> from the whole of the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS), i.e., since 1994, indicating that it is perhaps absent from most of its former range in the Mediterranean. Occasional specimens turn up serendipitously in the catch of demersal fisheries, for example one adult male was captured in recent years near Anzio, Italy, now deposited in the collection of the University of Naples (Psomadakis <em>et al.</em> 2005) and one specimen captured in the Southern Adriatic in 2000 (Dulčić <em>et al.</em> 2003) thus testifying that the species is not extirpated from the region. However, its occurrence today is so rare that it must have massively declined in the past 20 years. <br/> <br/>Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in terms of technology in the shelf and slope areas of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), but more recently effort has increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987). Since then half of the fishing effort has been displaced to targeting small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croation, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al.</em> 2001). Coastal development, pollution and anthropogenic disturbance through tourism activities are also a threat to its shallow coastal habitat in the Mediterranean. <br/> <br/><strong>West Africa</strong> <br/>Formerly common all along the west African coast, this species has suffered from fishing pressure, taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls and in artisanal fisheries. Targeted among other benthic sharks and rays, and caught in large mesh benthic gillnets targeting guitarfishes, shrimp trawls and various other benthic gear such as longlines and handlines. There is heavy fishing pressure throughout this species' inshore and shallow water habitat that is unlikely to be reduced in the coming years (M. Ducrocq pers. obs). Although large individuals are still landed sometimes from Mauritania south to Guinea, artisanal fishers and other observers indicate that the abundance has dropped severely and that the median size has been dramatically reduced as most of the adults have been removed by fishing activities (M. Ducrocq pers. obs). Even in the Banc d'Arguin National Park, Mauritania, where it is normally fully protected, the incidental captures consist of more than 90% juveniles and subadults while large individuals were common in the 1980s (M. Ducrocq pers. obs). Pregnant females have been observed in the landings of artisanal coastal fisheries in Mauritania, Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, suggesting that this species is giving birth in coastal shallow waters, where the fishing pressure is intense and is unlikely to reduce in the coming years (M. Ducrocq pers. obs).","No species specific management or protection is currently in place for this species, except for in the Banc D'arguin National Park, Mauritania where it is protected.",Decreasing,"This species is taken annually in the VIMS longline survey at a single site during the summer months, but no population trends are evident from 1996 to 2003 (Musick <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). Historically, <em>Gymnura altavela</em> was not uncommon in the catch of demersal fisheries (trawl and set nets) throughout the Mediterranean and the southern shores in particular. However, it is absent from the whole of the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) records (i.e., since 1994) and it is only the occasional specimens that have been caught in demersal fisheries that testify the species is not extirpated from the region. In southern Brazil it disappeared from beach-seine catches in 2002 to 2003, where it had been historically observed in the 1980s. Also in southern Brazil at latitudes 29°20'S to 33°40'S and depths 10 to 20 m, trawl survey catch rates standardized for groundrope length, and frequency of occurrence, were 16.0 kg/h and 54% in January 1982 (20 trawl hauls), and 0.2 kg/h and 8% in February 2005 (62 trawl hauls). The catches in 2005 were of small juveniles, indicating that reproduction still takes place in that area (Naves and Vooren 2001, Vooren <em>et al</em>. 2005).

This species can be common and abundant in the Sundarbans (Mukherjee <em>et al. </em>2013), and is very important to fisheries along the northwest and northeast coasts of India.

In 2013, overall catch of this species in India was 124,509 tons, which comprised 4-5% of the annual marine landings across the country (Behera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). It has been exploited by commercial fisheries in the Saurashtra region of India since at least 1947 (Fernandez and Devaraj 1996), where it comprised 24% of total fisheries catches from 1980-1984 and 13% from 2002-2006 (Ghosh 2014). It is currently considered overfished in the Saurashtra region of India, where from 1997-2011 (a 15-year period), catch peaked at 78,000 tons in 1998 and declined to 25,000 t in 2009, which represents a 68% decline.

It is also considered overfished in the Kakdwip region of West Bengal (Behera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). By comparison, the fishery for this species in east India developed later than that on the west coast, and catch has been increasing with effort from at least 1960 to 2006 with no indications of decline as of yet (Vivekanandan and Krishnakumar 2010). According to stock assessments, this species has been overfished in Bangladesh since at least the early 1990s (Mustafa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994, Islam 1995, Mustafa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998), or over about the past three decades (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The large quantities of juveniles captured in the fishery also contributes to overfishing (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Mohammed Koya<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). For example, in the Sunderbans, 59% of the catch of this species comprised immature individuals (Sharma 2014). Fishing effort has increased considerably in recent years (Hasin 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Western Pacific Ocean:</strong> Growth overfishing is also occurring for this species in China's coastal seas (Liang and Pauly 2017), where catches are now dominated by 0-1 year old fish (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is common and abundant off the coast of Zhejiang, China in the East China Sea (Shan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sambou <em>et al</em>. 2016) and in the Pearl River Estuary of South China (Sun <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual national catch of this species in Indonesia has been recorded since 1976, and catch peaked in 1983 at about 17,000 tons and declined thereafter by about 79% to 3,500 t in 2012, which is a period of 29 years (Nugroho <em>et al.</em> 2015). In North Kalimantan, Indonesia, this species has been heavily exploited since the 1990s, and there are anecdotal reports from the fishing industry that landings and body size of individuals in the catch has been declining since the early 2000s (Prasetyo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, the stock is considered fully exploited in that area, and further increases in fishing effort would likely lead to overfishing (Nugroho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/>When calculated over a three generation period (10 years), data represent a decline in global landings of c.30%. Given that effort is either increasing or stable across much of the fished range, there is evidence of growth overfishing, and data shows severe historic declines, the actual decline in global population of this species highly likely to be close to Vulnerable thresholds under Criterion A2.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Attempts to develop directed fisheries for the bluntnose sixgill shark have rapidly collapsed in California waters, usually lasting less than three years (Compagno in prep. a).

However, both indices have since declined to around 1.04 and 0.23 (stratified mean number per tow) for females and males respectively in 2006. Abundance of lobsters has also shown considerable fluctuations since 1982 between 6 million and 9.5 million lobsters (Target = 8.61 million, threshold = 7.95 million, Idoine 2006).

A number of countries have imposed national minimum legal size limits, closed fishing seasons, and have prohibited the collecting of berried females. In an effort to protect lobster spawning potential in some areas, berried females caught may be V-notched on the tail before being returned to the sea.&#160; Under local by-laws or voluntary bans, such lobsters may not be landed until the V-notch has grown out (M.

This species occurs in a number of marine protected areas.<br/><br/>Aquaculture production of lobsters is a small industry at present, but there is a growing interest in its potential for areas where there have been significant population declines. There are 3 types of aquaculture practice: product enhancement, resource enhancement and full grow out. Product enhancement removes undersized wild individuals and then maintains them in culture facilities where they are fed until they reach a marketable size. Resource enhancement or stock enhancement has been practised for the last century, especially within north american and european fisheries. Local fisheries are regularly stocked with hatchery reared individuals. This practise was developed at a time when there was some concern that the wild fisheries would not be able to keep with the rate at which wild stocks were being exploited.",Stable,"This is an abundant species that is harvested in commercial quantities in parts of its range.

Abundance data are limited in many areas and catch is often not species-specific (i.e., lumped with other grouper species). According to stock assessment biomass data, catch and catch per unit effort data, this species is suspected to have undergone at least a 30% global decline or more over the past 41 years (1975-2016), which is nearly one past generation length (46.5 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next two generation lengths (93 years) due to no anticipated changes in exploitation rates or management efforts.<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong> In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, this species has been targeted by the commercial deepwater longline fishery since 1975 (SEDAR22 2011). The most recent stock assessment classified this species as not overfished with overfishing not occurring as of 2009, but model runs indicate it is on the boundaries of these definitions (SEDAR22 2011). Total biomass steeply declined beginning in the early 1980s due to overfishing, levelled off by 1993 at 12,912 metric tonnes, and has been stable at this lower level ever since. Total biomass in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico declined by 61% over 34 years from 33,667 in 1975 to 13,004 metric tonnes in 2009. In addition, spawning biomass declined by 68% over the same time period (30,319 to 9,593 metric tonnes) (SEDAR22 2011). An earlier stock assessment by Cass-Calay and Bahnick (2002) suggested that a decline in longline catch per unit effort (CPUE) had occurred for this species since commercial fishing commenced. A fishery independent survey conducted in the northern Gulf of Mexico since 1972, reported that relative abundance indices of this species significantly declined after 1985 (Pollack and Ingram 2010). This species has also been targeted by both recreational and commercial fisheries in the southeast U.S. Atlantic since at least 1962; commercial landings have been highly variable, and do not have an overall trend from 1962 to 2002; catch per unit effort in the recreational headboat fishery has generally been minimal, but declined by over 90% over 22 years from 0.008 in 1980 to 0.0001 in 2002 (Williams and Dixon 2003; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>In Mexico, this species comprises 1% of the mixed-grouper and snapper fishery catch. The grouper fishery, which is typically dominated by catch of<em> Epinephelus morio</em>, has experienced a 50% decline in landings and catch per unit effort over the past 30 years (Instituto de la Pesca 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Cuba: </strong>This species is naturally uncommon in Cuba, and is rare in fisheries catch.<br/><br/><strong>Venezuela: </strong>Snappers and groupers (including this species) have traditionally been exploited on the continental shelf and slope of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago by artisanal fishers, and catch has significantly declined due to overfishing (Mendoza and Larez 2004). The main species exploited by the handline and longline fisheries include the southern red snapper (<em>Lutjanus purpureus</em>) and <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> (Mendoza and Larez 1996). Catch and effort of <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> generally increased from 1981 to 1991 when catch peaked at about 2,400 tons. Since then, catch and effort have been declining and historic lows were registered in the last years of the series (Mendoza and Larez 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>In 1997/1998, a fishery independent survey conducted along the southern Brazilian upper shelf and slope (São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul) considered this species to be 'rare' (0.5 kg per 1,000 hooks per hour and 1.4% of total catch by weight). It was also considered patchily distributed with the highest concentrations recorded at Santa Catarina around Florianópolis from 120 to 135 metres depth specifically on flat mud bottoms near deep trenches (Revizee-Score 1999, Haimovici <em>et al</em>. 2004, Haimovici pers. comm. 2007). There is no targeted fishery in Brazil, but it is retained as bycatch in longline and gill net fisheries that target Snowy Grouper (<em>H. niveatus</em>) and tilefish (<em>Lopholatilus villarii</em>) (A. Olinto pers. comm. 2007). It also occasionally occurs in bottom trawl fisheries that target angel sharks from 80 to 150 metres depth (M. Peres pers. comm. 2006). In southern Brazil, bottom longline and gill net fisheries targeting mainly wreckfish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>), snowy grouper and tilefish have dramatically increased over the past decade. It has been recorded in commercial landings in the states of São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, but statistics are generally lumped with other grouper (cherne) species. Santa Catarina State records commercial landings for <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> under """"chene-galha-amarela"""", because it is a particularly important component of the catch in that area, but it may also be registered under the """"cherne"""" category. In Santa Catarina, annual grouper landings declined by about 96% from 262,500 kg in 2002 to less than 10,000 kg in 2006 (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, where this species is apparently less naturally abundant, annual grouper landings declined by 84% from 1998 to 2005 (from about 98,000 to 16,000 kg; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information) and by 90% from 1996 to 2005 (from about 400,000 to 40,000 kg; Figure 4 in the Supplementary Information), respectively. It is inferred that population trends of <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> mirror the documented overexploitation of the target species within this fishery (Haimovici <em>et al</em>. 2004, BRASIL 2004, Avila-da-Silva and Haimovici 2005). In addition, due the decline in target species, some longline fishers have redirected effort to other grouper species, which likely includes <em>H. flavolimbatus </em>(Peres pers. obs. 2007).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

There is a small commercial fishery for this species in Louisiana in the U.S., and landings may be increasing due to the exclusion of grouper longliners inside of 50 fathoms (J.

Recommendations for population recovery include increasing protection for males and reduce capture of juvenile/immature individuals (Moore and Labisky 1984, Wyanski <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). There is strong evidence from the Madison-Swanson Marine Reserve that no-take zones in shelf-edge habitats protect deep-water species such as this (Koenig and Coleman 2013).

According to landings and catch per unit effort data and stock assessment biomass models, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% over the past two generation lengths, a period of 40 years. This decline is expected to continue over the next generation length (20 years) due to insufficient conservation measures in most of its range.<br/><br/><strong>U.S. South Atlantic: </strong>A fishery-independent trap and bottom longline&#160;survey conducted on the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf and edge from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to St. Lucie, Florida from 1996-2011 reported the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species as variable; increasing between 1996‐2002, decreasing from 2002-2008, and then slightly increasing since 2008. A similar survey conducted in the same area, but using bottom longline, reported a variable CPUE over the time period, with a general increase from 1996 through 2009, and a possible decrease in more recent years (Ballenger and Smart 2013). From June 1985 to April 1986, 21 trips by two vessels fishing at depths of 137-194 m off Onslow Bay, North Carolina captured 1,094 fish, 92% of which were individuals of this species. By early August 1985, it was estimated that over 60% of the exploitable biomass has been removed, and within the year, over 80% had been removed (Epperly and Dodrill 1995). Wyanski <em>et al.</em> (1999) suggested that the population of this species was overfished in North and South Carolina due to the relatively high proportion (56%) of immature females&#160;in the catch in 1993-1994,&#160;the proportion of males declined from 7-23% in the 1970s and 1980s to 1% in the 1990s, and the&#160;mean length of fish landed in the longline fishery had steadily declined from 65 to 80 cm total length in the early 1980s to 50 to 60 cm in the mid-1990s.<em>&#160;</em>Commercial landings in the Atlantic states appeared in official statistics in 1981, peaked in 1990 at 255 metric tonnes and declined thereafter to 61 mt in 2016, which represents a 76% decline over the past 26 years (NMFS database <a href=""""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"""">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). The first stock assessment for the U.S. Atlantic was conducted in 2004, and concluded that overfishing began in the mid-1970s and continued through at least 2002 (SEDAR4 2004). The next stock assessment, which was published in 2013, concluded that spawning stock had declined until the mid-1990s and then increased gradually over the last decade, but that the stock remains overfished. However, fishing mortality declined to a level where overfishing is no longer occurring, and at the current fishing mortality, the stock is projected to recover within the rebuilding time frame (SEDAR36 2013). Overall, total biomass in the U.S. Atlantic declined by 59% from 1976-2013 (37 years) and spawning stock biomass declined by 75% from 1974-2012 (38 years; SEDAR36 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Gulf of Mexico:</strong>&#160;This species is more common within the Madison-Swanson Marine Reserve than in other shelf-edge habitats of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Koenig and Coleman 2013). According to NMFS, the annual recreational harvest in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico estimates of both number (N) and weight of&#160;<em>H. niveatus</em>&#160;averaged 7,619 fish and 15,641 kg in 1996 to 2005. Landings peaked at 87,298 fish and 280,263 kg in 1981. [Note: there are very large proportional standard errors (PSE) associated with the annual estimates of landings, which suggest these are rare-event landings in the recreational fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico] (T. Sminskey pers. comm. 2006). Commercial landings in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico states appeared in official statistics in 1985, and have fluctuated between about 65-110 mt since 1986 with no overall trend (NMFS database <a href=""""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"""">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). No formal stock assessment is available for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.&#160;In the southern Gulf of Mexico, off the northern coast of the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula, there is not any official record of the species. It is possible that this species is pooled with catches of <em>Epinephelus itajara</em> due to the relative similarity between them (A. Aguilar-Perera pers. obs). In Mexico, landings for this species are estimated to be less than 1% of the mixed-grouper and snapper catch. In Cuba, this species is rare in the fishery because it is found in deeper waters.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil:&#160;</strong>From 1986 to 1995, <em>H. niveatus</em> comprised 9.9% of the total catch by bottom line fisheries (201-650 m) in southeast Brazil (Paiva and Garcez 1998). Among the species observed in the industrial landings in south Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), from 1989-1999, <em>H. niveatus</em> (cherne-verdadeiro) was captured frequently during the 1990s, but was never abundant (1 to 30 individuals per boat; M.

It is heavily fished locally (both adults and juveniles), and subjected to oil pollution in some estuaries. It is marketed fresh or frozen, and probably also dried and used in fishmeal. This species local importance has increased as other, more desirable, species have been reduced in abundance (Munroe in press).<br/><br/>There is a high risk of both recruitment and growth overfishing for this species, especially if it is to be found that it also makes up a large proportion of the usually discarded catch of the shrimp fishery operating in deeper waters (Vakily and Cham 2004). It has been previously mentioned that larger specimens of <em>I. africana</em> are generally missing from the catches of the beach seines at the sampling site. This selectivity towards smaller and younger individuals of the population is most likely due to the size-dependent distribution of the species, the larger ones usually being found in deeper waters and thus out of reach for beach seines (Vakily&#160;and Cham 2004).<br/><br/>In the Androni River system in Nigeria, fishing mortality for this species is estimated to be very high (F&gt;1.34; Francis and Samuel 2010).

Recreational fishing effort has also been increasing during the same time period from approximately 4,000 fishing trips in 1990 to 37,000 trips in 2005.

It is also accidentally caught by commercial fishermen with surface drift nets by trolling, harpooning and set netting. It is most important as a sports fish. The flesh is dark red and not as good as that of marlin. Sport fishing could pose a potential threat locally, especially as this species is found primarily near shore and around islands.<br/><br/>The greatest catch rates in the world for sailfish occur in the Eastern Pacific ocean off Central America where this species supports multi-million dollar sport fisheries (catch and release) (Erhart and Fitchett 2006). In the national long-line fisheries in Costa Rica, many of the fishes are discarded as the fisheries are only allowed to bring in 15% of the catch as sailfish, so that catch are likely under reported. Costa Rica dominates the catch in the Eastern Pacific. Recent catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from the recreational fishery off of Central America has generated cause for concern (Kitchell <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2004).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, this species is taken primarily by longline fisheries, but also by purse seines, and by some artisanal gears which are the only fisheries targeting marlins (Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire) and also by various sport fisheries located on both sides of the Atlantic. The increasing use of anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs) by various artisanal and sport fisheries is increasing the vulnerability of these stocks. Many assessment model results show evidence of overfishing, more so in the eastern than in the western Atlantic stocks (STECF 2009).","This is a highly migratory species is listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>Size limitations, encouragement of catch-and-release sport fishing, and recommendations for using circle hooks instead of J-hooks are measures designed to increase survival in catch-and-release sport fishing (Serafy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009). In some areas long-lining is restricted to protect populations of billfishes for sports fishermen. The sports fisheries have mostly developed catch and release programmes rather than keeping the fish. In Costa Rica, Sailfish cannot be targeted in commercial fisheries and can only be landed as bycatch. Only 15% of catches are allowed to be sailfish, so some of the fish are discarded and the catch is likely under reported.<br/><br/>The catch of Sailfish by Japan, Korea, and Taiwan include the catch of Spearfish, though species-specific catch data are beginning to be collected in the Japanese longline fishery. It is probable that there may be other source of bias in landing information. It is necessary to review and check the catch of billfish country by country in detail (Uozumi 1999).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, the International Commission fr the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT-SCRS) in 2009 recommended that catches for the eastern stock should be reduced from current levels. The Committee recommended that catches of the western stock of sailfish should not exceed current levels. Any reduction in catch in the West Atlantic is likely to help stock re-growth and reduce the likelihood that the stock is overfished. Artisanal fishermen harvest a large part of the sailfish catch of the western sailfish stock. The ICCAT-SCRS is concerned about the incomplete reporting of Sailfish catches, particularly for the most recent years, because it increases uncertainty in stock status determination. The ICCAT-SCRS recommends all countries landing or having dead discards of Sailfish, report these data to the ICCAT Secretariat (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/>No ICCAT regulations for Sailfish are in effect, however, some countries have established domestic regulations to limit the catch of Sailfish. Among these regulations are, requirement of releasing all billfish from longline vessels, adoption of circle hooks, and catch and release strategies in sport fisheries (ICCAT 2009). Regulations for the U.S., Bahamas and Bermuda include no commercial sale. The Mexican government allows Sailfish to be taken only with sport fishing gear (de Guevara <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2011).",Unknown,"Sailfish are divided into stocks of the Western Atlantic, Eastern Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific and Indian Oceans.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>There are two stocks of Sailfish in the Atlantic: one in the western Atlantic, and one in the eastern Atlantic. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the status of Atlantic Sailfish stocks, but most models present clear evidence of overfishing and that stocks are overfished, more in the east than in the west. The eastern stock is more productive than the western, probably providing greater maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The eastern stock is probably suffering stronger overfishing and has been reduced further below the level that would produce MSY than the western stock. Both eastern and western stocks suffered greatest declines prior to 1990. Since 1990, trends in relative abundance conflict between different indices, with some indices suggesting declines, other increases, and others not showing a trend. Examination of length frequencies do not show changes in the average length or length distribution&#160; (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/>Using combined indices of relative abundance (Table 9, ICCAT 2009), both eastern and western Atlantic Sailfish stocks appear to be stable or increasing over the three generation length period (13 years). The combined indices were chosen over the biomass indices, as the population models which estimated biomass were not considered to be a good fit to the available data. Overall, there is data uncertainty, but the combined indices suggest no strong changes over the length of period examined. The greatest declines in Atlantic Sailfish occurred prior to the three generation lengths.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Eastern Pacific Ocean</span><br/>There has been no effort to assess the status of Sailfish or Spearfish species in a comprehensive manner in the Pacific. There has been no stock assessment for the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP).

There has not been any real directed fishing for this species recently. It is a very important sportfish in the ETP. There are some indications of localized declines. Overall Sailfish abundance is 80% below the 1964 levels in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama (Erhart and Fitchett 2006).

The majority of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2017), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015, Campana <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality, although such mortality is reported at 10% for recreational fishing (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, French<em> et al. </em>2015). Commercial post-release mortality has  been reported as 30–33% for the Shortfin Mako on longlines (Campana <em>et al. </em>2016b).

In 2008, the Shortfin Mako was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation. In 2018, Mexico announced its intention to propose adding the Shortfin Mako to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). If the proposal is adopted at the 2019 CITES Conference, Shortfin Mako exports from CITES Parties would need to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>Globally, there are very few limits on Shortfin Mako catch. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Shortfin Mako and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Whereas the European Union implemented this measure through domestic regulations, it has yet to limit Shortfin Mako catch from anywhere else, even as Spain is consistently the world’s top Shortfin Mako fishing nation. A 2017 measure agreed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;–&#160;in response to scientific advice to ban retention of overfished north Atlantic Shortfin Makos&#160;–&#160;instead aims to maximize live release by narrowing the conditions under which Shortfin Makos from this population can be landed.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended Shortfin Mako landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on Shortfin Mako catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, and promotion of safe release protocols are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Shortfin Mako. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins (Schrey and Heist 2003, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) stock assessments in the north Atlantic and south Atlantic (ICCAT 2017); (2) stock assessment in the north Pacific (ISC 2018); (3) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the south Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014); and (4) a preliminary stock assessment in the Indian Ocean (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, while the previous north Atlantic stock assessment suggested low probability of overfishing and that stocks were healthy (ICCAT 2012), the most recent north Atlantic stock assessment revealed that the stock was both overfished and that overfishing was occurring (ICCAT 2017). The south Atlantic stock assessment biomass estimates were deemed unreliable by the stock assessors, although they inferred that fishing mortality is likely unsustainable (ICCAT 2017). This concern is corroborated by a recent analysis of standardized catch rates of Shortfin Mako on longlines in the south Atlantic that revealed steep declines of 99% in the average CPUE of 1979–1997 and 1998–2007 (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016a). As a result of the unreliable stock assessment, the north Atlantic stock assessment was considered as representative of the south Atlantic for the trend analysis. The trend analysis of the north Atlantic modelled biomass for 1950–2017 (68 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated median decline of 60.0% over three generation lengths (75 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the north Pacific stock assessment revealed that the stock was likely not overfished and that overfishing was likely not occurring (ISC 2018). The trend analysis of the modelled spawning abundance for 1975–2016 (42 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.6%, consistent with a median decline of 36.5% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths. Although the stock assessment used a long data time series of 40 years, the trend analysis considered the population change over a longer period of 72 years, which results in a greater decline than that of the stock assessment.<br/><br/>Third, the New Zealand longline observer Shortfin Mako standardized CPUE for 1995–2013 (19 years) (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014) was used to represent the catches in that region as it is observer data with good coverage, comes from the part of the region with highest catch rates, and Shortfin Mako move between New Zealand waters and areas further north. The trend analysis indicated annual rates of increase of 0.5%, consistent with a median increase of 35.2% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the Indian Ocean preliminary stock assessment indicated that the Shortfin Mako stock is not currently overfished but subject to overfishing, however the biomass trajectories trend towards overfished with overfishing status (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1971–2015 (45 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.9%, consistent with a median decline of 47.9% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Shortfin Mako and Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.12 (time range 135 years) and biomass of -0.15 (time range 106 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferreti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Shortfin Mako was estimated to be declining in all oceans, other than the south Pacific where it is increasing. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 46.6%, with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (72–75 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Endangered A2.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

However in 2002, 2003, and 2004 mean weight decreased again to 1.08 kg but then increased to 1.13 kg in 2007. Length frequency data suggests that there has been no significant change in the mean length of males and females between 1995 and 2000. Numbers of spawning adults has decreased significantly between 1997 and 2007 by about 77% from around 0.09 spawners/potlift to 0.02 spawners/potlift in 2007. Biomass estimates for the fishery indicate a 70% decline since 1980 when it was estimated at 5,311 tonnes compared to the estimate of 1,581 tonnes in 2007.

In 1993 a TACC of 1,720 was implemented of which only 1,668 tonnes was harvested. Since 1996 there has been a gradual increase in landings to around 1,900 tonnes but then declined slightly to 1,849 tonnes in 2007. Since the peak in landings in 1991, fishing effort has been reduced dramatically from its peak in 1991 at 2 million potlifts to a low of 854,000 potlifts in 2002. It has since increased again to 1,661,428 potlifts in 2007. Catch per unit effort rose from 0.93 kg/potlift in 1996 to 2.1 kg/potlift in 2002, but then fell again to around 1.1 kg/potlift in 2007.</p><p>Mean weight of lobsters in 2007 is similar to that seen in the 1970s at around 0.83 kg though it has varied considerably over time between 0.77 and 0.89 kg. Length frequency data suggests that there has been no significant change in the mean length of males and females since 1993 when the quota was introduced. Numbers of spawning individuals has dramatically declined from a high in 2002 of 0.51 spawners/potlift to 0.14 spawners/potlift in 2007. Biomass estimates for this fishery show that it peaked in 2002 at 6,085 tonnes but has since declined to around 4,041 tonnes in 2007. Egg production levels have also shown a similar trend with a high of 684 billion eggs in 2003 and a low of 460 billion eggs in 2007.</p><p><strong>Victorian Rock Lobster Fishery</strong></p><p>This fishing zone is split into the Western Zone and Eastern Zone.</p><p>Landings in the Western Zone have fluctuated considerably since 1978 but recently peaked at ~550 tonnes in 2000 and then declined to ~330 tonnes in 2006 (Department of Primary Industries 2008).

In the Eastern Zone landings were high in the late 1970s at ~120 tonnes but declined to ~70 tonnes in the late 1980s where they have remained ever since(Department of Primary Industries 2008). CPUE in this region also declined from around 0.70 kg/potlift in the late 1970s to a low of ~0.25 kg/potlift in 1996 but have since increased to ~0.42 kg/potlift in 2006 (Department of Primary Industries 2008).</p><p><strong>New Zealand Fishery</strong></p><p>This fishery covers the North and South Islands, as well as the Chatham Islands.

Despite voluntary conservation measures, mandated minimum size limits, and wide acceptance of catch-and-release, white marlin are currently considered to be severely overfished (Restrepo <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2003, Jesien <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2006). The most recent assessment (ICCAT 2007) states that the biomass for 2000–2004 most likely remained well below the BMSY estimate in the 2002 assessment (ICCAT 2007). The observed distribution of several large pelagic predators, including the white marlin, has significantly contracted from the 1960s to 2000 (Worm and Tittensor 2011). A petition to declare white marlin an endangered species in the USA was not accepted (White Marlin Review Team 2002).<br/><br/>The increasing use of anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs) by various artisanal and sport fisheries is increasing the vulnerability of these stocks (STECF 2009).","This is a highly migratory species mentioned in the Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>Size limitations, encouragement of catch-and-release sport fishing, and recommendations for using circle hooks instead of J-hooks are measures designed to increase survival in catch-and-release sport fishing (Pine <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al. </span>2008, Serafy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al. </span>2009).   In the US Atlantic, commercial harvest and import of either species of marlin is prohibited. The recreational fishery is limited to a total landing of 250 blue and white marlin combined per year. Bermuda and Bahamas similarly do not allow commercial harvest of these species. Mexico allows no commercial take within 50 miles off its coast. In the Brazilian Atlantic, there is a mandatory release of all live marlin caught and a prohibition of sale of any marlin landed. There are no conservation measures for this species in the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendations [Rec. 00-13], [Rec. 01-10] and finally [Rec.  02-13] placed additional catch restrictions for blue marlin and white  marlin. The latter established that “the annual amount of blue marlin  that can be harvested by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels and  retained for landing must be no more than 33% for White Marlin and 50%  for Blue Marlin of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is  greater”. That recommendation established that, “All Blue Marlin and White Marlin brought to pelagic longline and purse seine vessels alive  shall be released in a manner that maximizes their survival. The  provision of this paragraph does not apply to marlins that are dead when  brought along the side of the vessel and that are not sold or entered  into commerce”. Catches of both species have declined since 1996–99,  the period selected as the reference period by the recommendations.  Since 2002, the year of implementation of the last of these two  recommendations, the catch of white marlin has been at about the 33%  value recommended by the Commission. This analysis represents only  longline caught marlin even though the recommendations referred to the  combined catch of pelagic longline and purse seine because the catch  estimates of billfish by-catch from purse seine vessels are more  uncertain than those from longline. In 2006, more countries started  reporting data on live releases. Additionally, more information  has come about, for some fleets, on the potential for using gear  modifications to reduce the by-catch and increase the survival of  marlins (STECF 2009).<br/><br/>The ICCAT-SCRS in 2006 requested the ICCAT, at a minimum, to continue the management measures already in place because marlins have not yet recovered. The Commission should take steps to assure that the reliability of the recent fishery information improves in order to provide a basis for verifying possible future rebuilding of the stocks. Improvements are needed in the monitoring of the fate and amount of dead and live releases, with verification from scientific observer programs; verification of current and historical landings from some artisanal and industrial fleets; and complete and updated relative abundance indices from CPUE data for the major fleets. Should the Commission wish to increase the likelihood of success of the current management measures of the marlin rebuilding plan, further reduction in mortality would be needed, for example by: implementing plans to improve compliance of current regulations; encouraging the use of alternative gear configurations, including certain types of circle hooks, hook/bait combinations etc., in fisheries where its use has been shown to be beneficial; broader application of time/area catch restrictions.<br/><br/>Given the recent importance of the catch from artisanal fisheries, and to increase the likelihood of recovery of marlin stocks, the Commission should consider regulations that control or reduce the fishing mortality generated by these fisheries. The Commission should encourage continued research on development of methods to incorporate this information into stock assessments in order to provide a basis for increasing the certainty with which management advice can be provided. STECF stresses the need for correct identification and reporting of billfish species in all EU fisheries.",Decreasing,"This species is occasionally caught in the Mediterranean Sea with no known population information. It is unclear whether there are two separate stocks or a single population in the Atlantic (Collette <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2006). The most recent ICCAT stock assessment considers a single stock in the Atlantic (ICCAT 2007).<br/><br/>Catch for the Atlantic: recorded since 1956 when total catch was minimal; peaked in 1965 at nearly 5,000 t, then oscillated between 1,000 and 1,500 t until 1993; increased to 1,900 t in 1994; declined below 1,000 t from 1995–2004 (ICCAT 2007). During the 2006 marlin assessment it was noted that catches of Blue Marlin and White Marlin continued to decline through 2004. The estimate for 2005 was 597 t. The recent biomass most likely remains well below BMSY estimated in the 2002 assessment. Over the period 2001–2004 combined longline indices and some individual fleet indices suggest that the decline has been at least partially reversed, but some other individual fleet indices suggest that abundance has continued to decline. Confirmation of these recent apparent changes in trend will require at least an additional four or five years of data, especially since the reliability of the recent information has diminished and may continue to do so.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the decrease in catches is associated with ICCAT regulations that were put in place in 2001 regarding the mandatory release of live white marlin taken by pelagic longlines. In addition in 2003, there was the imposition of catch limits to 33% of the 1996 or 1999 reported values. Countries are now reporting their landings, not their total catch.<br/><br/>The most recent stock assessment (ICCAT 2007) used a Bayesian Surplus Production model to estimate biomass from 1990 through 2006. The remaining data series (1956–1989) are based on biomass estimates from the previous stock assessment (ICCAT 2003). Population declines were examined using a generation length estimated between 4.5 and 6.5 years. Over a three generation length period of 13 years, the decline was 8.67% and over a three generation length period of 20 years, the decline was 36.74%. These declines were calculated using the biomass estimate of the first to the last year of the range examined. Population reduction for Atlantic White Marlin was therefore estimated to be between 9% and 37%.<br/><br/>In addition, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding biological parameters for this species.

Commercial catch is taken mostly by surface long lining with less than 1% of the total catch taken by harpooning. The quality of the flesh is among the best of the billfishes for sashimi and sushi. It marketed mostly frozen, sometimes fresh. The observed distribution of several large pelagic predators, including the striped marlin, has significantly contracted from the 1960s to 2000 (Worm and Tittensor 2011).<br/><br/>In the western central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), catches of Striped Marlin were dominated by the Japanese longline fleet until the early 1990s. Taiwanese and Korean fleets have reported relatively small catches of Striped Marlin since the mid 1960s and mid 1970s, respectively. However, Taiwanese catches have increased in recent years, mainly due to the high effort of this fleet in the eastern temperate WCPO, targeting mainly Albacore Tuna. Longline fleets of Pacific Island Countries and Territories, and by Australia and New Zealand, have reported increasing catches since the early 1990s mainly due to the development of these domestic fleets. Catches by Australian longline fleets have rapidly increased in recent years due, at least in part, to specific targeting of striped marlin by some vessels during some periods. Since 1987, longline fleets operating in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have been prohibited from landing Striped Marlin in an attempt support recreational fisheries in the north of the country (Kopf 2005). Extensive recreational fisheries exist throughout the southwest Pacific Ocean (Whitelaw 2001, Bromhead <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2004, Kopf 2005) although total catches by recreational fisheries are very small relative to commercial catches. In addition, a high proportion of Striped Marlin are (tagged and) released by recreational fisheries in the WCPO (up to 60%, Holdsworth <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2003, in Kopf <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). However, studies into the survival of recreationally captured marlin have estimated that between 0–50% of marlin suffer post-release mortality due to hook damage, stress or increased susceptibility to predation (Pepperell and Davis 1999), although studies are rare, sample sizes are typically small and the durations of monitoring of post-released fish are relatively short (e.g., maximum of 93 days for Striped Marlin, Domeier <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/>Fishing in the tropical eastern Pacific region is by both industrial and artisanal fisheries.

The large increase in catch observed in the past 10 years is primarily due to fishing with fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the equatorial eastern Pacific. There is a continuously increasing exploitation rate in the EPO, but models do not predict widespread population decline (IATTC 2008). Given the reduction in larger predators, it is expected that this species is relatively abundant.

At present, the major fisheries are the purse seine fisheries, particularly those of Spain, France, Cape Verde, Guatemala and Ghana, followed by baitboat fisheries of Ghana, Spain and France. Increasing harvests and fishing effort could lead to involuntary consequences for other species that are harvested in combination with Skipjack Tuna. In the West Atlantic, the major fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet (STECF 2009). The Brazilian bait boat fleet of Santa Catarina State yields almost half of the Skipjack Tuna catches in the West Atlantic (Andrade and Kinas 2004).With respect to the West Atlantic, the fishing effort of the Brazilian baitboats seems to be stable over the last 20 years.&#160; There has been a recent increase in Skipjack Tuna catchability from 1–13% per year since the early 1980s. The change in the selectivity pattern observed for the purse seine fishery suggests that this fleet is mainly targeting juvenile tunas (ICCAT 2008). In the insular Caribbean, this species is important to the artisanal fishery (Mahon 1996). In the Mediterranean, this species may be caught with drift nets.<br/><span class=""""apple-style-span""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-style-span""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""></span></span><span class=""""apple-style-span""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-style-span""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><p></p></span></span></span>","This is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) previous to 2008, the Inter-America Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) had small area-wide closures for 6-weeks on purse-seining for tuna in the eastern Pacific.All purse-seine vessels of more than 182 metric tonnes of carrying capacity that fish in the EPO for Yellowfin, Bigeye, and Skipjack tunas were required to stop fishing in the EPO for a period of 59, 62, and 73 days during 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The closures can be for either of two periods, August–September or November–January (ISSF 2010). Skipjack Tuna is a notoriously difficult species to assess. Due to Skipjack’s high and variable productivity (i.e., annual recruitment is a large proportion of total biomass), it is difficult to detect the effect of fishing on the population with standard fisheries data and stock assessment methods. This is particularly true for the stock of the EPO, due to the lack of age-frequency data and the limited tagging data. One of the major problems mentioned above is the uncertainty as to whether the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the purse seine fisheries is an appropriate index of abundance for Skipjack Tuna, particularly when the fish are associated with fish-aggregating devices (FADs). Purse seine CPUE data are particularly problematic, because it is difficult to identify the appropriate unit of effort (Maunder 2010). Since the stock assessments and reference points for Skipjack Tuna in the EPO are so uncertain, developing alternative methods to assess and manage the species that are robust to these uncertainties would be beneficial.<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, there is currently no specific regulation in effect for Skipjack Tuna. However, with the aim of protecting juvenile Bigeye Tuna, the French and the Spanish boat owners voluntarily decided to apply a moratorium for fishing under floating objects between November and the end of January for the 1997–1998 and 1998–1999 periods. ICCAT implemented a similar moratorium from 1999 to January 2005. This moratorium has had an effect on Skipjack Tuna catches made with FADs. On the basis of a comparison of average catches between 1993–1996, prior to the moratoria, and those between the 1998–2002 period, the average Skipjack Tuna catches between November and January for the purse seine fleets that applied the moratoria, were reduced by 64%. During that period (1998–2002), the average annual Skipjack Tuna catches by purse seine fleets that applied the moratoria decreased by 41% (42,000 t per year). However, this decrease is possibly a combined result of the decrease in effort and the impact of the moratoria (the average annual catch per boat decreased only 18% between these two periods). This moratorium area was reduced significantly in spatial and temporal coverage in 2001. The ICCAT-SCRS recommends that catches not be allowed to exceed MSY (ISSF 2010, STECF 2009).<br/><br/>In the Western and Central Pacific, there is a limit on the use of FADs and purse seiners, and to reduce the catch of long liners to reduce bycatch for Bigeye Tuna, all of which may have positive conservation effects for this species.",Stable,"Reported worldwide landings fluctuate greatly, but show a gradual increase from 158,600 tonnes in 1950 to 2,480,812 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>Catch summary statistics for 2000–2004 and the status of the stock (Majikowsk 2007) include the following:&#160; 93,000–133,000 tonnes/year in the Eastern Atlantic where the status of the stock is unknown; 22,000–31,000 tonnes/year in the Western Atlantic where the status of the stock is unknown; 422,000–489,000 tonnes/year in the Indian Ocean where the status of the stock is Moderately to Fully exploited; 282,000–439,000 tonnes/year in the Eastern Pacific where the status of the stock is Moderately exploited; 1,136,000–1,295,000 tonnes/year in the Western and Central Pacific where the status of the stock is Moderately exploited.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO)</span><br/>FAO landings data from 1976–2005 vary from approximately 25,000–140,000 tonnes caught annually in the eastern tropical Pacific (FAO 2009). Landings data have been relatively constant over the last 20 years, and between 35,000 and 100,000 tonnes. In general, the Skipjack Tuna global population in the EPO has been high for the last 30 years perhaps related to increased frequency of El-Niño events. Therefore, the general eastward expansion of the Skipjack habitat predicted in this simulation is very plausible (Loukos <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2003, Worm and Tittensor 2011).<br/><br/>The last full assessment for Skipjack Tuna in the EPO was in 2005 (Maunder and Harley 2005), although an evaluation of a set of fishery indicators was given in 2008 (Maunder 2010). Reported landings from 1976–2005 (IATTC 2008) varied from 52,000–311,000 metric tonnes per year in the Eastern Pacific including California. The recruitment of tuna to the tropical eastern Pacific region is highly variable and is thought to be the reason for the large variations in stock size. The average weight of this species has been declining since 2000, and the 2007 average weight is approaching the lower reference level. The biomass, recruitment, and exploitation rate has also been increasing over the past 20 years. The main concern with this species' stock is the constantly increasing exploitation rate. However, the data- and model-based indicators have yet to detect any adverse consequence of this increase. There have been observed declines in average weight, and average weight is near its lower reference level, which can be a consequence of overexploitation, but it can also be caused by recent recruitments being stronger than past recruitments (IATTC 2008, Maunder 2010). For example, a group of relatively strong cohorts entered the fishery in 2000–2003.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO)</span><br/>Within the equatorial region, fishing mortality increased throughout the modelled period (1952–2007) and is estimated to be highest in the western region in the most recent years. The impact of fishing is predicted to have reduced recent biomass by about 40% in the western equatorial region and 20% in the eastern region (Langley and Hampton 2008). However, this most recent assessment for Skipjack Tuna in the WCPO (Langeley and Hampton 2008) concluded that the stock was not in an overfished state nor was overfishing occurring. Nothing has been observed in the fishery that indicates that this conclusion should be changed, although some mild concern over possible shifts in distribution of Skipjack Tuna in the northern regions of the WCPO has been expressed (Joseph 2009, ISSF 2010).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Indian Ocean</span><br/>An attempt was made in 2003 to assess the stock status but due to the large uncertainties in the information needed to conduct a complete assessment, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) only analysed different fishery indicators that could provide a general understanding of the state of the stock (i.e., trends in catches and nominal catch per unit effort (CPUE), average weight in the catches, length-based cohort analysis (IOTC 2008, IOTC 2009, STECF 2007). In spite of not having a full stock assessment for this species, the analysis did not show reasons for concern, as catches have continued to increase as effort increased and the majority of the catch comes from fish that are already sexually mature (greater than 40 cm), as the fishing pattern by size indicates. However, length-based cohort analyses indicated a growing catch of smaller size fish due to the fishery with fish aggregating devices (FADs) (STECF 2007).<br/><br/>Preliminary data indicate that catches in 2007 may be the lowest since 2002 (IOTC 2009), possibly due to the lack of fishing in areas patrolled by pirates. However, the range of stock indicators available does not currently signal any problems in the fishery, and catches have continued to increase as effort increased (IOTC 2009, STECF 2009). Furthermore, the majority of the catch comes from fish that are sexually mature (greater than 40 cm) and therefore likely to have already reproduced (STECF 2009). The IOTC has recommended that this species should be carefully monitored given current fishing pressure as it is clear that current catches cannot be increased indefinitely (IOTC 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The Atlantic population is divided into eastern and western stocks; with the eastern stock contributing the majority of catches (~ 80%). Stock assessments for eastern and western Atlantic Skipjack Tuna were conducted in 2008 using available catches to 2006 (STECF 2009). In summary, it appears that both stocks in the Atlantic are currently being fished at levels below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), and the stocks are not being overfished, and are not considered to be in an overfished state (ISSF 2010). The total catches obtained in 2008 in the entire Atlantic Ocean were close to 149,000 t which represents the catch average of the last five years (STECF 2009). This species is not abundant in the Mediterranean with FAO reported landings fluctuating around 100 t from 1996–2005. Although catch is slowly increasing in the Mediterranean in recent years, statistics in the Mediterranean are incomplete (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Atlantic, the preliminary estimates of catches made in 2008 amounted to 127,000 t, representing an increase of 3% as compared to the average of 2003–2007. A Bayesian method, using only catch information estimated the MSY (under a Schaefer-type model parametrisation) at 143,000–156,000 t, a result which agrees with the estimate obtained by the modified Grainger and Garcia approach: 149,000 t. In addition, two non-equilibrium surplus biomass production models were applied for eight time series of CPUEs, and for a combined CPUE index weighted by fishing areas. In general, the range of plausible MSY values estimated from these models (155,000–170,000 t) were larger than in the Bayesian model based on catches. It is therefore difficult to estimate MSY under the continuous increasing conditions of the exploitation plot of this fishery (one-way of the trajectory to substantially weaker effort values) and which as a result, the potential range distribution of some priors needs to be constrained (e.g., for growth rate, or for the shape parameter of the generalized model) (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009). Although there are discrepancies among various models that create difficulty in estimating MSY, it is unlikely that Skipjack Tuna is over exploited in the eastern Atlantic (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009).<br/><br/>In the Western Atlantic, the major fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009). Catches in 2008 in the West Atlantic amounted to 22,000 t representing a decrease of 17% as compared to the trend observed for recent years. Catch only model estimated MSY at around 30,000 t (similar to the estimate provided by the Grainger and Garcia approach) and the Bayesian surplus model (Schaefer formulation) at 34,000 t. Other analyses using Multifan-CL indicated MSY convergens to about 31,000–36,000 t. For the western Atlantic stock, in light of the information provided by the trajectories of B/BMSY and F/FMSY, it is unlikely that the current catch is larger than the current replacement yield (ICCAT 2009, STECF 2009).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

It is worth noting that Tetraodontids in general were considered undesirable in the region until the late 1970s and 1980s, and only began to be utilized as food sources as other species (groupers, breams, barracudas,&#160;snappers, etc.) became rare.

It is also a valued target game fish species for recreational fishing in Ireland and UK. The low reproductive capacity and high commercial value of both mature and immature age classes makes this species highly vulnerable to over-exploitation and population depletion. Well documented declines in this extremely valuable species during the past fifty years in the North Atlantic, which is the major reported source of world catches, has taken place during a period of rising fishing effort and market demand, and improved fisheries technology.  <br/> <br/>Porbeagles are a valuable secondary target of many fisheries, particularly longline fisheries, also gill nets, driftnets, pelagic and bottom trawls, and handlines. Examples include the demersal longlines for Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides in the southern Indian Ocean and by the Argentinean fleet (Victoria Lichtstein, CITES Management Authority of Argentina, in litt. to TRAFFIC Europe, 27 October 2003), and longline swordfish and tuna fisheries in international waters off the coasts of Argentina and Uruguay (Domingo undated). Despite the large amount of fishing activity capturing porbeagles in the Southern Hemisphere, New Zealand is the only country that reports landings to FAO, indicating that the southern catch is largely unreported.  <br/> <br/>The high value of porbeagle shark meat means that most """"bycatch"""" is exploited. The exception is in those high seas tuna and billfish fisheries where vessels' holding space is too limited to enable even valuable shark carcasses to be retained; in these cases the fins alone may be retained (e.g., the Japanese longline fishery for southern bluefin tuna off Tasmania and New Zealand, the pelagic fishing fleets of other countries in the southern Indian Ocean and probably elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere (Compagno 2001)). Northeast Atlantic. <br/> <br/>Porbeagle has been fished in this region by many European countries, principally Denmark, France, Norway and Spain. There has never been any restriction on fishing effort on this stock. The Northeast Atlantic fishery began when Norway started targeting porbeagle in the 1930s using longlines. Norwegian landings first reached a peak of 3,884 t in 1933. About 6,000t were taken by the Norwegian fleet in 1947, when the fishery reopened after the Second World War, followed by a progressive drop in landings to between 1,200 and 1,900 t from 1953 to 1960. The collapse of this fishery led to the redirection of fishing effort by Norwegian and Danish longline shark fishing vessels into the Northwest Atlantic. Norwegian landings from the Northeast Atlantic subsequently decreased from 160 to 300 t per annum in the early 1970s to only 10 to 40 t per year in the late 1980s/early 1990s, while average Danish landings fell from over 1,500 t in the early 1950s to less than 100 t throughout the 1990s (DFO 2001a, Gauld 1989).  <br/> <br/>French and Spanish longliners have operated directed fisheries for porbeagle since the 1970s. Reported landings from the main French fishing grounds in the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay decreased from over 1,092 t in 1979 to 3 to 400 t in the late 1990s. Spanish vessels appear to have taken porbeagle opportunistically both in the early and late 1970s and since 1998. Landings off Spain tend to be greater during the spring and autumn, with a drop in the summer (Mejuto 1985, Lallemand-Lemoine 1991). It is unclear, however, whether the very variable early landings data from the Spanish fleet (from nil to nearly 4,000 t per year) represents huge variations in catches, possibly the result of """"boom and bust"""" fisheries removing different segments of the stock, or differences in catch reporting. Bonfil (1994) estimated that 50 t of porbeagle were taken as a supplementary catch in the Spanish longline swordfish fishery in the Mediterranean and Atlantic during 1989. The long line fishery in the Bay of Biscay (ICES Area VIII), directed at the more abundant blue shark, also landed about 30t of mainly porbeagle and some shortfin mako <em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em> during 1998 to 2000. ICES data (Heessen 2003) indicate that annual landings from Area IXa into mainland Portugal peaked at almost 3,000 t in 1987 to 1988 and have since declined (these records do not appear in the FAO statistics). <br/> <br/>Reported landings from the historically most important fisheries, around the UK and in the North Sea and adjacent inshore waters have decreased to very low levels during the past 30 to 40 years, while catches from the offshore ICES sub-regions west of Portugal, west of the Bay of Biscay and around the Azores have increased since 1989. This is attributed to a decline in heavily fished and depleted inshore populations and redirection of effort to previously lightly exploited offshore stocks. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong> <br/>This species has virtually disappeared from Mediterranean records. In the North Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Sea Serena and Vacchi (1997) reported only 15 specimens of porbeagle during a few decades of observation. Soldo and Jardas reported only nine records of this species in the Eastern Adriatic since the end of 19<sup>th</sup> century until 2000. Recently two new records were reported (A. Soldo unpublished data). Orsi Relini and Garibaldi (2002) reported two newborn porbeagles were caught as bycatch of the swordfish longline fishery in the Western Ligurian Sea. A young porbeagle, considered to be very recently born was reported in the central Adriatic Sea (Orsi Relini and Garibaldi 2002). A young specimen was also caught in the central Adriatic during big-game fishing. On the basis of its length, it is suggested to be of an age 1 to 17 months (Marconi and De Maddalena 2001). These records indicate a possible nursery area in Central Mediterranean. During research of bycatch in the western Mediterranean swordfish longline fishery no porbeagles were caught (De La Serna <em>et al</em>. 2002). Only 15 specimens were caught during research conducted in 1998 to 1999 on bycatch of sharks in large pelagic fisheries: catches were reported only in the southern Adriatic and Ionian Sea, mainly by driftnets (Megalofonou <em>et al</em>. 2000). Official statistics for Mediterranean area show that the only landings in the Mediterranean were reported in 1996 by Malta: 1 t (FAO 2002). Porbeagles are also popular as recreational species (big game fishing) in some areas of Mediterranean.  <br/> <br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic</strong>: <br/>Porbeagle fishing in the Northwest Atlantic started in 1961, when the fleet of Norwegian shark longliners began operating off the coast of New England and Newfoundland after the Northeast Atlantic stocks had been depleted. Catches increased rapidly from about 1,900 t in 1961 to more than 9,000 t in 1964. By 1965 many of the vessels had switched to other species or moved to other grounds because of the population decline. The fishery collapsed after only six years, landing less than 1,000 t in 1970. Smaller landings were also reported by Faeroese fishing vessels from around the same time and throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Norwegian and Faeroese fleets have been excluded from Canadian waters since the establishment of Canada's EEZ in 1995. Canadian and US authorities reported all landings after 1995. Porbeagle sharks are now taken almost exclusively by a Canadian directed longline fishery. Bycatch in swordfish longline fisheries and various inshore fisheries are minimal, rarely exceeding 40 t in recent years (DFO 2001a). <br/> <br/>Following the collapse of the fishery in the 1960s, it took ~25 years for recovery to ~30% of virgin biomass to take place. Three Canadian vessels entered the targeted Northwest Atlantic fishery in 1994. Catches of 1,000 to 2,000 t per year throughout much of the 1990s reduced population levels to a new low in under ten years: the average size of sharks and catch rates (number/hook) were the smallest on record in 1999 and 2000. By 2000, catch rates of mature sharks were reduced to 10% of the 1992 peak, and immature catch rates to 30% of the 1991 peak. The biomass in 2000 was estimated as 11 to 17% of virgin biomass and fully recruited F estimated as 0.26 (DFO 2001a). The current porbeagle population is seriously depleted and will require a greatly reduced fishing mortality if recovery is to occur (DFO 2001). The 2001 stock assessment by the Canadian Department of Fisheries states: """"An annual catch of 200 to 250 t would correspond to fishing at about MSY and would allow population growth."""" Following this advice, the Canadian quota was reduced to 250 t for the period 2002-2007 to allow population growth and recovery. There is a small quota (92 t) for porbeagle in the US EEZ.  <br/> <br/><strong>Southern Oceans</strong>: <br/>Little information is available for southern ocean porbeagles. Landings from the Southern Hemisphere are only reported to FAO by New Zealand in the Pacific southwest. New Zealand reported landings were 150 to 300 t per year between 1998 and 2003 (Sullivan <em>et al</em>. 2005).  <br/> <br/>Records of captures of porbeagle by the Uruguayan pelagic tuna longline fleet declined significantly during 1981 to 1998 (A. Domingo undated). During the 1980s, only the two most valuable shark species were retained for their meat: porbeagle and mako <em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>, representing about 10% of the total longline catch and peaking at 150 t and 100 t landed, respectively, in 1984. By the early 1990s, landings of these two species had fallen to around 10% of that peak, although shark fin prices were rising and blue sharks Prionace glauca and eight other species of large sharks were now also being retained in large quantities. This was accompanied by a decrease in CPUE from 110 kg/1,000 hooks (1988) to 1 kg/1,000 (1999) in the Uruguayan tuna and swordfish fleet. This is not, however, necessarily due to population decrease but to changes in fleet operating maneuvers (area and depth) and an increase in mean temperatures of water masses in the area (A. Domingo pers. comm.). There is bycatch of porbeagle shark in the Chilean artisanal and industrial longline swordfish Xiphias gladius fishery within and outside the Chilean EEZ, between 26 and 36°S (E. Acuña unpublished data; Acuña <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are no good estimates for captures in the Southeastern Pacific off Chile; several times porbeagle has been included as <em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>. Acuña <em>et al</em>. (2002) determined during a one year sampling period that <em>L. nasus</em> catches were around 3.5% of the total catch of fishes (in numbers) in the Chilean swordfish fishery, with a size range between 75 and 245 cm TL.  <br/> <br/>Porbeagles recently showed up as bycatch of demersal longlines for the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides in the southern Indian Ocean (Compagno 2001). Porbeagles are rarely seen in South African waters; being occasionally caught in research vessel longline cruises (L.J.V. Compagno pers. comm). An experimental tuna longline fishery operated in South African waters from 1997 until March 2005. Porbeagles were seldom caught in the experimental fishery. Catches were mainly along the southwest coast of South Africa and observed catch rates were approx. 0.014 sharks per 1,000 hooks. Since March 2005 the fishery has been commercialized with the allocation of 17 swordfish-directed vessels and 26 tuna-directed vessels. The current foreign flagged vessels in the commercial fishery target yellowfin tuna in the warm Agulhas current and are unlikely to catch significant quantities of porbeagle. In contrast, foreign flagged vessels, especially Japanese, which target Southern Bluefin Tuna to the south of South Africa, land substantially more quantities of porbeagle as bycatch (C. Smith, pers. comm). <br/> <br/>See the Supplementary Material for Table 1: bycatch of porbeagle in South African pelagic longliners; and Table 2: seasonal trend in bycatch.","<strong>International</strong>:  <br/>The porbeagle shark is included on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which lists """"Family Isurida"""" (former name for Family Lamnidae) among other oceanic sharks. The UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks establishes rules and conservation measures for high seas fisheries resources and has been in force since 2001. It directs States to pursue co-operation in relation to listed species through appropriate sub-regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements. No progress with implementation of shark fisheries management appears to have been achieved. <br/> <br/>In 2004, the EU rejected a proposal from Germany for the EU to submit an Appendix II listing proposal to the 13<sup>th</sup> Conference of Parties to CITES, with the objective of ensuring the sustainability of fisheries supplying international trade. There is no regulation of the international trade demand for meat that is driving many fisheries. However, the porbeagle is one of the subjects of CITES Decision 13.42, directed to Parties, which states that Parties should take note of the species-specific recommendations in document CoP13 Doc. 35 Annex 2 with a view to ensuring that international trade is not detrimental to the status of these species (<a href=""""http://www.cites.org"""">CITES</a>). The relevant section reads: """"The Animals Committee concluded that North Atlantic populations have been severely depleted and noted that quotas in EU waters apply only to non-EU fleets through access agreements. As these quotas are far higher than can be supported by the stock and do not restrict fishing effort they are not considered to be an effective management measure in this case"""". The Animals Committee recommended the following: <br/> <br/>a) ICCAT members are encouraged to collect and report data on catches and discards of porbeagle sharks, as per ICCAT Resolution 95-2, which has yet to be complied with, and undertake stock assessments in order to develop management recommendations. Other relevant Regional Fishery Management Organizations are encouraged to establish and implement similar programmes.  <br/> <br/>b) The US and Canada are encouraged to enhance existing management for their shared porbeagle stock by establishing a cooperative, bilateral research and fisheries management programme. <br/> <br/>c) The World Customs Organization (WCO) is encouraged with urgency to establish a harmonized international code for porbeagle sharks. <br/> <br/>Two Regional Fisheries Organisations, ICCAT and IATTC, have adopted finning bans, as have several range states (e.g., USA, EU, Australia, Brazil etc.). More are likely to follow suit.  <br/> <br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic</strong>:  <br/>The 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada established precautionary catch levels of 1,500 t for porbeagle in the target shark fishery. License limitation, a ban on finning, restrictions on gear, area and seasons, bycatch limits and restrictions to recreational fishers permitting hook and release only were also implemented (Hurley 1998). The porbeagle TAC was reduced to 1,000 t in 1997 (O'Boyle <em>et al</em>. 1998), then to 1,700 t during the two years 2000 to 2001 while additional scientific information was collected (DFO 2001b). As a result of these studies, it was concluded that the population was seriously depleted (to 10 to 20% of virgin biomass) and would require a greatly decreased fishing mortality if recovery is to occur. An annual catch of 200 to 250 t would correspond to fishing at about MSY and would allow population growth. However, annual catch levels of about 1,000 t would be sustainable over the long term once the population has recovered. These DFO analyses, which are the basis for the regional assessment, are contested by COSEWIC (2004), who notes that the quota for 2002 to 2007 of 200 to 250 t represents a substantial reduction from catches in the mid-1990s, but even this amount now corresponds to a high exploitation rate because of the low population abundance. It is highly uncertain if this quota reduction will be sufficient to halt the porbeagle decline, and if so, to what extent the population will recover, given that there is uncertainty in estimating FMSY and the quota, the low number of mature animals remaining in the population, that at its current low abundance the population may experience depensation (Allee effects), and that reduction in fishing pressure is not always sufficient for population recovery (Hutchings 2001). COSEWIC (Committee on the status of endangered wildlife in Canada) designated porbeagle as Endangered in 2004 (COSEWIC 2004). <br/> <br/>Since 1993, shark fisheries in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters in the US have been managed under the Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean. The plan set commercial quotas in the US EEZ for 10 species of pelagic sharks at 580 t dressed weight annually, with recreational bag limits also applied. There is a small quota (92 t) for porbeagle. Commercial fishers require an annual shark permit, and finning is prohibited. <br/> <br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>:  <br/>Norway is allocated a quota of 200 t of porbeagle in European Community (EC) waters, reduced in 1985 from the 500 t established in 1982 (Gauld 1989). Since 1985, the Faeroe Islands can also take 125 t from EC waters (originally 300 t in 1982, 150 t in 1984a). These quotas currently exceed total landings from shelf areas in the region and yield no management benefit.  <br/> <br/>Annex V of the Convention on the Protection and Conservation of the Ecosystems and Biological Diversity of the Maritime Area [also called OSPAR (Oslo-Paris) Convention] requires OSPAR to develop a list of threatened and/or declining species and habitats in need of protection or conservation in the OSPAR maritime area (Northeast Atlantic). OSPAR member states were invited in 2001 to submit proposals for inclusion on this list. In response, Portugal, on behalf of the Azores, proposed to list porbeagle <em>Lamna nasus</em> in the wider Atlantic because of its biological sensitivity, keystone importance and the severe decline in its population. This proposal has not yet been adopted. <br/> <br/>The status of the largely unmanaged, unmonitored Northeast Atlantic stock is likely worse than the seriously depleted Northwest stock, with stringent conservation and management action (fisheries closure and stock assessment) needed urgently to enable stocks to rebuild to levels where sustainable commercial and recreational fisheries are possible.  <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>:  <br/>The species is listed on Annex III, """"Species whose exploitation is regulated"""" of the Barcelona Convention Protocol concerning specially protected areas and biological diversity in the Mediterranean, signed in 1995 but not yet ratified. The Mediterranean population of this species was also added in 1997 to Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats) as a species whose exploitation must be regulated in order to keep its population out of danger. No management action has yet followed these listings. The draft action plan for the conservation of cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyans) in the Mediterranean Sea (Anonymous 2002) has identified porbeagle as a species that urgently needs development of a management programme for sustainable fisheries.  <br/> <br/><strong>Southern Oceans</strong>:  <br/>In 1991, Australia brought in legislation that prevented Japanese longliners fishing in the EEZ from landing shark fins unless they were accompanied by the carcass. Since 1996, these vessels have not fished in the Australian EEZ.  <br/> <br/>The Southern African population of porbeagles is largely unmonitored and little data is available on bycatch levels in the longline fisheries of this region. However, all foreign flagged vessels in the South Africa fishery are required to have 100% observer coverage, whereas domestic vessels are required to have 20% observer coverage (C. Smith, pers.comm). The bycatch must be monitored and this porbeagle assessment reviewed within five years of the opening of this fishery. <br/> <br/>A small, regulated fishery is permitted by New Zealand, which included porbeagles in its quota management system in October 2004, with a TAC set at 249 t (Sullivan <em>et al</em>. 2005). There are no other management measures applicable to the Antarctic and Southern Ocean, since CCAMLR appears not to be monitoring or managing this species.",Decreasing,"North Atlantic tagging studies (DFO 1999, Kohler <em>et al</em>. 2002, Stevens 1990) indicate only one trans-Atlantic movement (Kohler and Turner 2001), implying that the two north Atlantic populations are distinct. There is no evidence of genetic exchange between the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere population(s), which are separated by warm water. The number of subpopulations in the southern oceans is unknown.  <br/> <br/>Biomass of the Northwest Atlantic porbeagle population was estimated at 4,409 t (11% of virgin biomass) and female spawners estimated at 6,075 (10% of the virgin abundance) (Campana <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/> <br/>Populations studied in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean segregate by size and sex. Although adults are very rare in the Mediterranean, it appears to be a nursery ground. <br/> <br/>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for Figures 1 to 7 (catch rates and landings data).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

It is perceived by villagers to be decreasing in abundance (Golden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). There is evidence of high abundance in protected areas in Fiji.&#160;From 2008-2014, regional estimates of the density of&#160;<em>L. harak </em>ranged from 0.09-1.2 individuals per hectare over hard bottoms to 30 m depth in Pacific coral reef areas surveyed by NOAA (NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The highest density was in the Samoa region (0-7.1 individuals per hectare) as compared to the lowest, in the Northern Mariana Islands region (0-0.6 individuals).&#160;The species was not recorded in the Hawaiian Islands or the U.S. Line and Phoenix Islands (NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).<p>&#160;Timor-Leste NOAA surveys from 2008-2014 showed a density of 2.5/ha&#160;(NOAA unpublished data in Heenan <em>et al. </em>2014). In Fiji, the density was&#160;87.5/ha (S. Jupiter, unpublished data). In the&#160;Federated States of Micronesia, density ranged from 1.3/ha (Kosrae) to 3.8/ha (Guam) and this species was not observed in other sites (B. Taylor, unpublished data)</p>  <p>&#160;In the Solomon Islands, this species occurs occasionally, in shallow waters with sand or rubble bottoms&#160;(Allen 2006).&#160;In the Philippines, this species is heavily exploited and although there are indications of local declines, it still occurs commonly in the markets.&#160;</p>The majority (94%) of the&#160;<em>L. harak&#160;</em>taken in&#160;the multi-gear fishery of southern Kenya were well below lengths of first maturity. The length at first capture was 8.4 cm, while the length at maturity was 23.3 cm (Mangi and Roberts 2006).&#160;Catch statistics from the Central Statistics Office of Mauritius show a decrease of <em>L. harak</em>&#160;representation in the total small-scale commercial catch from 1994 to 2008 (0.8% in 1994, 0.4% in 1995, 0.3 in 1996, and 0.0 from 1997 to 2008 with the exception of 1998 and 2004 when a proportion of 0.1% was recorded) (Harper and Zeller 2011).&#160;In Mozambique, this species is a major component of multi-species fisheries and is predominantly caught by hook and line (Kiszka 2012).&#160;This species was observed at each of six fringing coral reef sites around Nose Be island in the northwest of Madagascar and was found in high numbers over sandy patches (Lindén&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;In Rodriguez Island, western Indian Ocean the relative importance of this species in fisheries catches declined dramatically between 1994 and 2006. While being among the 6 species which accounted for 29% of the catch in 1994 to 1996, in 2004-2006 this overall proportion had decreased to only 6%. Fishermen in the area also reported perceived decreases in abundance of<em> L. harak. </em>This species was once among the seven most common species in the seine catch in this area and was among the 11 species for which minimum legal landing size limits were listed in the Fisheries Act of 1980. This species has&#160;since become an insignificant component of the catch (Hardman <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Populations in this area exhibited both growth and recruitment overfishing.&#160;<em>Lethrinus lentjan </em>was among the three most abundant species which accounted for over 60% of the individuals in the catch. Across all gear types over 90% of the landed <em>L. lentjan</em> were below the length of maturity, with 99.6% of those landed by beach seine being under the length of maturity (Hicks and McClanahan 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>This species was among the top five&#160;dominating&#160;fish species identified in Chwaka village (near Zanzabar, Tanzania) fish market in both the monsoon and the dry season,&#160;contributing 7 to 10% of the observed catch (Torre-Castro <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Twenty-six percent of the total catch of fishes in were classified as being juvenile. Eleven percent of the total juveniles caught were&#160;<em>L. lentjan</em>&#160;(Unsworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>The modal age of all samples of&#160;<em>L. lentjan</em>, which indicates full recruitment to the common gear configuration used in the Great Barrier Reef line fisheries, was 8 years, which corresponds to 42% of the estimated maximum age of 19 years (Currey<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013). In Northern Australia this species was common in trawl surveys operating at depths of 55 to 64 m (Ramm and Xiao 1995).&#160;The species components of these mixed stocks exhibit variation in lifespan, maximum size, and spawning season. Variations in life history among a suite of species taken in the same fishery are likely to result in different responses to fishing pressure (Currey<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>This species is among the most important species taken in handline fisheries in New Caledonia (Kulbicki<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2000). It is rare in the Solomon Islands (Green<em> et al.</em> 2006) and a low abundance was reported in the Great Barrier Reef (1994-2014) and has not been recorded in underwater surveys since 2007 (AIMS unpublished data). In the Philippines, this species is very heavily exploited but is still locally abundant and appears commonly in the markets (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2015); however, often only juveniles are represented in the markets.&#160;In the Fiji, the recorded density for this species was 0.1/ha (S.

Total fisheries production has decreased by approximately 25% from the late 1980s to the mid 2000s (Al-Zaidan <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011) complied size frequency data&#160;for&#160;<em>L. lentjan</em><em>&#160;</em>in the southern Gulf&#160;from commercial catches made off the coast of Emirate of Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates between September 2008 and August 2009. Biological data was collected from individuals purchased from commercial catches during the same time period.&#160;The mean age and size at sexual maturity for male&#160;<em>L. lentjan</em><em>&#160;</em>was 1.8 years and 24.6 cm&#160;<em>L</em><sub>m</sub>&#160;and 2.4 years and 27.7 cm&#160;<em>L</em><sub>m&#160;</sub>for females.&#160;The ratio of males to females in the southern Gulf was estimated as 1 : 1.9 (M:F), though Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011) noted the samples were significantly female biased.&#160;Grandcourt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011) estimated the natural, fishing and total mortality for&#160;<em>L. lentjan</em><em>&#160;</em>to be 0.22 year<sup>-1</sup>, 0.22 year<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.44 year<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

The fishing mortality was also lower than both biological reference points, target (<em>F</em><sub>SB40</sub>&#160;= 0.56) and limit (<em>F</em><sub>SB30</sub>&#160;= 0.73).&#160;Between 2001-2002, Paighambari and Daliri (2012) sampled shrimp trawl fisheries by-catch composition in the Bushehr province (Iranian waters). During the 2001 fishing season,<em>&#160;</em>7.249&#160;kg of&#160;<em>Lethrinus lentjan</em><em>&#160;</em>were collected as by-catch, which comprised of 0.044% of the total catch, respectively.

In Kenya, the high rate of capture of juveniles of this species by the artisanal fishery, increasing fishing effort and inadequate protection causes over-exploitation (Samoilys <em>et al.</em> 2017). It has also declined in Rodrigues (Hardman<em> et al.</em> 2013).","This species is found in marine protected areas within its range (IUCN-UNEP 2018). Surveys in 2011 and 2012 revealed that the abundance of this species within a network of small no-take zones established in 1995 off Sinai, Egypt was higher than in fished areas (Galal 2012). It occurs within Kenyan marine protected areas where fishing is restricted (Kaunda-Arara and Rose 2004). Improved protections that include fishing regulation, fishery monitoring and enforced reserves are needed in Kenya (Tuda<em> et al</em>. 2016, Samoilys&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

It is frequently exploited in multi-species artisanal fisheries throughout its range, but little is known on the potential impact of this pressure on its population due to the paucity of fishery data collection.&#160;<br/>This species is common off Kenya, and along with another species referred to as “<em>L. miniatus</em>”, comprises greater than 80% of the commercial reef fish catch by number (Kaunda-Arara and Rose 2004). Siganidae and Lethrinidae species form the bulk (~40%) of artisanal reef fish landings in coastal Kenya, and landings declining by 40% during the 1990's.&#160;Length frequency analysis indicated above optimum exploitation and fishing mortality rates for this species off the coast of Kenya in the early 2000's (Kaunda-Arara <em>et al</em>. 2003). The majority (84.6%) of individuals of this species<em>&#160;</em>taken in&#160;the multi-gear fishery of southern Kenya were immature. The length at first capture was 9.6 cm, while the length at maturity was 20.14 cm (Mangi and Roberts 2006). Individuals ranging in size from 14.3 to 27.4 cm were landed in African basket traps in a heavily-fished Kenyan coral reef lagoon dominated by sand, seagrass and coral reef (Mbaru and McClanahan 2013). The lack of fishery data collection and species-specific information in Kenya's large multi-species artisanal fisheries result in unknown population status of this species there (Tuda<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016). It is also a component of the artisanal drag-net fishery of Zanzibar (Torre-Castro <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/>About 90% of the Nazareth and Saya de Malha bank fisheries catch in Mauritius is comprised of this species and catch per unit effort fluctuated from 1989 to 2004 (Dharmendra and Sólmundsson 2005). The Mauritius seine net fishery of Rodrigues Island is over-exploited and catch per unit effort has declined at a significant, but generally unquantified rate since 1994. This species in particular frequently occurred in the catch in the late 1970's, but is now rarely caught (Hardman <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is an important fishery that this species contributes to along the Tamil Nadu coast of India, but very little is known on the status of its population there (Vasantharajan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;This species is exploited for local use and export in Oman (Farid pers. comm. 2018). An underwater survey conducted on fishing grounds at Nabq, Egypt, recorded a decline in the mean number of individuals per 8,000 m<sup>2&#160;</sup>of this species from 19.3 in 1995 to 8.2 in 2011/2012&#160;likely in response to increased fishing effort. Abundance in a network of small no-take zones increased from 11.3 in the year of establishment to 14.9 in 2010/2011 (Galal <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). It is also a major component of the multi-species fishery of Socotra Island off Yemen where fishing effort has been increasing, but the population status is also unknown (Hassan Ali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).

In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. The relative contribution of&#160;<em>L. obsoletus&#160;</em>is currently unknown. Catch-per-unit-effort has declined consistently from &#160;the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010 CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing; however, CPUE in 2010 is 1/2 &#160;that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive. In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Green&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Lethrinids in Guam have an Annual Catch limit of 38,720 lbs. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished; however, there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012).<br/>The commercial bottomfish fishery in American Samoa was established from 1982-1985.

Additionally, declines in adjusted price of fish suggest declining fish consumption. In 2011 this species accounted for 11% of all bottomfish landings (3987 lbs/35,808 lbs). In 2012, Annual Catch Limits were implemented (WPRFMC 2012).

The relative contribution of<em>&#160;L. obsoletus</em>&#160;to the catch is unknown. Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011. Commercial landings of Lethrids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have particularly fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Catch-per-unit effort has declined consistently in the snorkel spear fishery from a series high of 3.5lbs/hour in 2000 to a series low of less than 0.25lbs/hour 2011.

It may also be taken as bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting anglerfish and longline fisheries targeting hake, though data on the catches in these fisheries are poor. If deepwater commercial fisheries expand into this species’ range they could pose a threat, although there is currently no indication of such expansion. European deepwater fisheries have decreased since 2008, but their effort and extent should be monitored. The relatively large body size would also indicate that it is vulnerable to overfishing. Due to its offshore habitat, it is of no importance to recreational fisheries.</p>  <p>Belgium and France are thought to still record Smalleyed Skate (<em>Raja microocellata</em>) landings erroneously as landings of this species, owing to the shared common name, ‘Sandy Ray’, which hampers the interpretation of some data (ICES 2012).</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This skate is a bycatch in multi-species trawl fisheries and offshore bottom longlines. Demersal trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low powered boats with a total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp. More recently effort has increased to a total of 19,940 hp (1974–1987) and more than half of the fishing effort has been displaced to target small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). Although little is known of the life history of this species, it is presumed from similar species that it is slow growing with low fecundity and large juveniles, making it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes including the egg cases are caught in fishing nets, as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is about 20 mm. Currently, the contents of the cod end are retained and the 20 mm mesh size commonly used in the Mediterranean Sea means that all life stages of this species are fished.</p>  <p>The main intergovernmental decision-making body on fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), has made the decision to refrain from expanding deepwater fishing operations beyond the limit of 1,000 m. This is still within the range of this species, as it is not known to occur below 800 m.</p>","<p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa and Subarea IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 metres was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999–2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore was not effectively managing catches. In 2009, skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES Subareas VI–IX) and have also been gradually reduced each year.</p>  <p>In 2006, the European Commission (EC) imposed a permanent ban on all deepwater gillnet fisheries operating at depths greater than 600 m, and imposed maximum limits on the length of nets deployed and the soak time in the remaining fisheries at depths less than 600 m (EC Regulation No. 41/2006). These restrictions may have been of some benefit to this skate. Additionally, since 2008 the EC obligated member states to provide species-specific landings data for the major North Sea species, including this species<em>,</em> in order to improve understanding of skate populations in the area (CEC 2008). In 2009, this obligation was extended to other ICES divisions, including the Celtic Sea (CEC 2009), and has been ongoing since 2008 (CEC 2013).</p>  <p>This skate was listed in Annex III of the Barcelona Convention in 2012, therefore any event of incidental catch and release should be recorded by masters of fishing vessels in the fishing logbook referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, in Mediterranean waters.</p>  <p>Moving forward, this species may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries, for example mesh size regulations and effort reduction. Appropriate non-trawling areas should be defined to protect a proportion of both the adult population and this skate’s eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end) (Ragonese<em> et al.</em> 2001). Further research should be conducted on the population size and trend of the species.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>There are two subpopulations of this species, with different situations for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It is likely that there is low connectivity between these two deepwater zones. The overall trend in European waters is of a decline.</p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>This species is rare in the Northeast Atlantic. Accurate determination of abundance trends over the broader area are not possible, as most earlier surveys have focused on shelf fishing grounds, with no long-term, standardised surveys sampling off the edge of the continental shelf. In the southern Northeast Atlantic, French landings data for this species have shown a decline of 92% over about 20 years, from about 500 tonnes per year in the early 1990s to less than 40 tonnes in 2012. French and Portuguese landings data from the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters across all gears combined have remained low but stable between 1999 and 2011, ranging from around 16–17 tonnes at the beginning and end of the time series, with a peak of 61 tonnes in 2005 (ICES 2012). Again, these data are potentially inaccurate owing to misidentification.</p>  <p>In the northern area of the Northeast Atlantic, English surveys in the North and Celtic Seas have not recorded this species since 1996 and 1997 respectively, although Scottish and Norwegian surveys have recorded it in various surveys around Scotland and along the north coast of Norway since then. Given the low numbers caught in offshore shelf habitats, it is possible that the main part of the range is now in deeper water, such as along the edge of the continental shelf. Indeed, most of the recent captures of this species in Scottish surveys have been from waters of 180–500 m depth. In the Norwegian Sea, the Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey on the north coast of Norway did not report any catches of this skate from 1992 to 2000. From 2000 to 2005 it was encountered in very low numbers (zero to nine individuals per survey), showing no particular trend in abundance (ICES 2012). Given the decline in French landings, and that the range has contracted to deeper waters in the Scottish surveys, it is assumed that the population has declined throughout the Northeast Atlantic. There is uncertainty over the magnitude of the decline in abundance for the population as a whole, owing to the lack of reliable data.</p>  <p>Throughout waters west of Britain and Ireland, the Spanish Porcupine Bank survey (on the western Ireland continental shelf) is the only survey that covers the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf, an important part of this species’ range. This survey recorded peak catches in 2003 and 2007, yet this limited time series has low (e.g., about 0.6 kg per haul in 2011) and variable catch rates, with a stable trend in recent years (ICES 2012). Historically, this species may have been more widely distributed in shelf seas west of Britain and Ireland. It is now encountered rarely in surveys on the inner continental shelf, but still exists in deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf. Given the reported decreases in survey and landings data, the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation is estimated to be declining.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>The occurrence of this species in the Mediterranean Sea has decreased significantly over the last 60 years. It was present in shelf and slope trawl surveys in the Gulf of Lions between 1957 and 1960 but was absent from more recent comparable surveys. Between 1957 and 1960, it was captured in more than 10% of hauls in shelf surveys and in approximately 17% of hauls in slope surveys, whereas between 1966 and 1995 it was not recorded at all from 1,295 hauls in eight trawl surveys (Aldebert 1997).</p>  <p>The International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) cover the northern Mediterranean coast almost continuously, from west Morocco and Spain in the west to the Aegean Sea in the east (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). Six trawl surveys were carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and Eastern (Aegean Sea). A total of 6,336 tows were completed between 1994 and 1999 at depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. This skate was recorded in only 12 hauls, all in the western area of the Mediterranean Sea (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). The evidence that this species may now be scarce in the western Mediterranean Sea points to a substantial reduction in area of occurrence. Its depth range also appears to have contracted, as it was previously found on shelf and slope bottoms between 70 and 275 m (mainly at around 100 m), but is now found only in deeper waters between 500 and 800 m (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001). The overall biomass index assessed through MEDITS in the west, north and eastern Mediterranean Sea was 0.1 kg per km<sup>2</sup> (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>  <p>Other records in the Mediterranean also show a decline in capture rates. In the south Ligurian Sea and north Tyrrhenian Sea this species is considered rare based on low capture rates. From 1985–2005 only 10 specimens were caught in the bathyal zone (352–566 m depth) (Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 1948, it was recorded in 3.2% of trawl samples from the Adriatic Sea but has been absent from all trawl survey data in this area since then (Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2013). It can be inferred that the Mediterranean subpopulation is decreasing given reported declines in capture rates from trawl survey data.</p><p>In European waters, the species is suspected to have declined overall by more than 50% in the last three generations (29 years).</p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

In the USA, there is a framework that could implement restrictions to the fishery if biomass levels fall below threshold levels (NEFMC 2003).<br/><br/>Recommendations for future conservation action: Enforce U.S. species-specific landings reporting requirements and increase scientific research and government sea sampling attention to skates; begin developing estimates for target and limit reference points; reduce discard mortality by encouraging and/or mandating more careful handling and discard techniques.",Decreasing,"The Little Skate (<em>Leucoraja erinacea</em>) is distributed from Nova Scotia, Canada to Cape Hatteras, USA and is one of the dominant members of the demersal fish community in the USA portion of the Northwest Atlantic (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953, Richards <em>et al</em>. 1963, McEachran and Musick 1977, Michalopoulos 1990). Its center of abundance appears to be the northern section of the mid-Atlantic Bight and on Georges Bank, where it is found year-round (McEachran and Musick 1977). In fact, survey estimates since 1997 have been and continue to be the highest on record for little skates. The 1999-2001 three-year average of 8.47 kg/tow is well above the proposed biomass threshold of 3.27 kg/tow and even above the proposed biomass target. Due to the overall increases in little skate biomass over the last 20 years which was at its highest level (NEFSC 2000). However, recent trawl surveys (2006) conducted by the National Marine Fisheries surface suggest that the little skate is near the overfishing threshold (18.7 vs. 20%) and will likely be above the threshold as of 2007. It is also near the minimum biomass threshold (3.32 vs. 3.27 kg/tow) and may become overfished (NEFMC 2007).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

In the Mediterranean Sea it is also caught as bycatch by both bottom trawl and longline fisheries (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Serena 2005). In the Northeast Atlantic it may also be taken as a bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting anglerfish and longline fisheries targeting hake, though information on the catches in these fisheries are poor.&#160;</p>","<p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 t for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa) and North Sea (ICES sub-area IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 metres was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999−2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore not effectively constraining catches. Additional management measures, including a 2006 permanent ban on all deepwater gillnet fisheries at depths of &gt; 600 m imposed by the European Commission (EC), may help to protect the deeper range of this species. The EC also imposed maximum limits on the length of nets deployed and the soak time in the remaining fisheries at depths of &lt; 600 m (EC Regulation No. 41/2006). </p>  <p>Skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters in 2009, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES sub-areas VI−IX). These TACs have also been gradually reduced since then. In 2013, the TAC for all skate and ray species grouped was 21,800 t (regulations are available online at <a href=""""http://faolex.fao.org/"""">http://faolex.fao.org</a>). Since 2008, the European Commission has obliged member states to provide species-specific landings data for the major North Sea species, including this species<em>,</em> in order to improve understanding of skate stocks in the area (CEC 2008). In 2009, this obligation was extended to other ICES divisions, including the Celtic Seas (CEC 2009), and has been ongoing since 2008 (CEC 2013). Additional management measures, including non-trawling areas in the Mediterranean Sea, could benefit this species as a fraction of the adult population and eggs are often found in trawl cod-ends (Ragonese <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>It is likely that there is poor connection between the two deepwater subpopulations of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. The overall population trend of this species is of a decrease.</p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>Accurate determination of abundance trends in the Northeast Atlantic is not possible, in the absence of long-term, standardised surveys sampling off the edge of the continental shelf. Historically, this species may have been more widely distributed in shelf areas in the Northeast Atlantic. Reported French landings for this species were more than 370 tonnes (t) in 1983, but since 1984 annual landings have been more stable and averaged about 75–150 t. English surveys in the North Sea have not recorded this species since 1998, though occasional specimens are taken in the Celtic Sea. It is now encountered only infrequently in surveys on the inner continental shelf, though is still present in deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf, suggesting that the main part of the range has contracted to deeper water. Indeed, most recent catches in Scottish surveys have been made in waters deeper than 200 m.</p>  <p>Catches of this skate around Iceland and eastern Greenland has been relatively stable overall, ranging from two tonnes in 1993 to 17 t in 2011, with the highest catch of 37 t recorded in 2001 (ICES 2012). While these catch volumes are low, confusion with Sailray (<em>Rajella lintea</em>) is believed to still occur, suggesting that true catch volumes may be even lower. The French Evaluation Halieutique Ouest Européen (EVHOE) Groundfish survey suggested an overall declining trend in abundance and biomass in waters west of Scotland and Ireland between 1997 and 2011, although this decline appeared to be stabilizing in 2010–2011 (ICES 2012). French landings from the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters have increased from three tonnes in 2000 to 32 t in 2011 (ICES 2012). Spanish landings from this region have been consistently low and stable, ranging from four tonnes in 2000 to eight tonnes in 2008. Purported Scottish landings of White Skate (<em>Rostroraja alba</em>) from these waters<em> </em>may also refer to Shagreen Skate (<em>Leucoraja fullonica</em>) because White Skate is considered depleted in this area (ICES 2013). Although levels of exploitation are unknown for this subpopulation, it is inferred to be declining due to a decrease in survey catch rates and landings.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This species was captured at depths ranging from 200–800 m in only seven of 6,336 tows during the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) performed throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea from 1994–1999 in depths ranging from 10–800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). It was absent from multiple trawl survey time series data that ran from 1957–1995 and consisted of eight separate surveys conducted by four different survey vessels in the Gulf of Lions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Aldebert 1997). Additionally, it was was absent from both recent and historical surveys in the Adriatic Sea (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al.</em> 2001). While further MEDITS surveys from 2008–2009 found ten specimens of the species<em> </em>in the southern Adriatic Sea (Zupa <em>et al</em>. 2010), an area it was previously thought to be absent from, it is possible that these specimens may have been incorrectly identified Sandy Skate (<em>Leucoraja circularis</em>). Trawl surveys in the south Ligurian Sea and north Tyrrhenian Sea suggest that the species is rare there, with few specimens captured between 1985 and 2004 at depths of 366–549 m (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005).

Increasing fuel prices are thought to have resulted in some fisheries operating closer to port, which may benefit offshore skates.<strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>Skates are an important component of the demersal fisheries of northwest Europe; when caught, this species is landed and sold (Holden 1977, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000).

It may be an important component in mixed demersal fisheries where abundant, and is landed as a bycatch in trawl fisheries throughout its Atlantic range, though smaller individuals tend to be discarded (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012). This skate is one of the more frequent species landed by the commercial fisheries operating in the Celtic Sea and Iberian waters. <span lang=""""FR"""">Craven <em>et al.</em> (2013) found it to be the dominant bycatch species of scallop dredge fisheries in the northern Irish Sea around the Isle of Man, constituting around 27% of total bycatch.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>The situation in the Mediterranean Sea may be similar to that in the Northeast Atlantic: this species may be part of the bycatch of multispecies trawl fisheries typical in the shelf seas of the Mediterranean basin. Demersal trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope areas of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. The continental shelf and upper slope are highly exploited, with intensive commercial trawling occurring at depths ranging from 50-800 m (Colloca <em>et al.</em> 2003, Massuti and Moranta 2003). Although only adult individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is approximately 20 mm. The relatively small size of this skate suggests that its life history and demography may allow some capacity to withstand moderate fishing pressure (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2000).</p>","<p>Though there are no species-specific management measures in place, there is a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays in the Northeast Atlantic, and this species may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries (e.g., mesh size regulations and effort reduction). More information on stock status is required, and the status of stocks in those areas where this species is exploited most (e.g., Celtic Seas) need to be better assessed.</p>  <p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a TAC for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa and Subarea IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 meters was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999-2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore not effectively constraining catches. Skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters in 2009, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and North Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES Subareas VI-IX) and have also been gradually reduced since then.

EC Council Regulation 43/2012 that established a TAC of 4,222 t in 2012 for skates (all species in the family Rajidae) in ICES Subareas VIII and IX (Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters) also indicated that catches of Cuckoo Skate and Thornback Skate should be reported separately (ICES 2013).</p>  <p>Further research should be conducted on the population size and trend of the species.</p>",Unknown,"<p><strong>Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>This is a relatively small-bodied species that is most abundant on offshore grounds and forms a relatively high proportion of skate landings in those areas where it is abundant. The catch rates below refer to all individuals (not just mature fish) and are typically nominal CPUE trends. Observed increases or declines tend to be of a moderate magnitude, but signals are inconsistent across surveys. </p>  <p>The highest catch rates of this species are found off the east coast of Scotland and around Orkney and Shetland. It is abundant in the northern North Sea, off northwest Scotland, the Irish Sea, the Celtic Seas, and is also one of the dominant skates around the Iberian Peninsula (ICES 2006). It is only rarely observed in the inner parts of the Bristol Channel and in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea. Preliminary stock assessments were made for the Celtic Sea stock during the Development of Elasmobranch DELASS project (Heessen 2003), though the results were inconclusive.</p>  <p>Mean abundance of this skate in the North Sea ecoregion appears to have increased from the late seventies to early eighties, followed by a sharp decline (Daan <em>et al</em>. 2005), and then by stabilisation in recent years at very low levels (ICES 2012). Fishery-independent mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the species for quarter one of the international bottom trawl survey in the North Sea was ~0.5 individuals per hour from 2010 to 2011, falling above the mean for the period 2005 to 2009, having increased by ~60% in three to four years from a low of ~0.2 individuals per hour in 2007 (ICES 2012). The stock is concentrated in the northern and central parts of the North Sea. For quarter three of the survey, mean CPUE for 2010 and 2011 was also higher than the mean for the period 2005 to 2009, having increased by ~53% in three to four years from a low of approximately 0.38 individuals per hour in 2007, to approximately 0.8 individuals per hour in 2011 (ICES 2012). The exploitation level of the North Sea stock is still unknown. It should be noted that survey catch rates are based on all individuals, rather than adults alone.</p>  <p>The stock structure of this skate in the Celtic Seas and waters west of Britain is insufficiently known, which makes the interpretation of catch rates in the various surveys more problematic (ICES 2012). As an offshore species that is also present in the Bay of Biscay (VIII) and northern North Sea (IVa), it is possible that the stock or stocks extend out of the Celtic Seas ecoregion. The French EVHOE survey of this ecoregion suggested peaks in relative abundance in 2001, 2002, 2007-2008 with the lowest catch in 2000 (ICES 2012). </p>  <p>The Spanish survey on the Porcupine Bank indicated recent decreases in catch rates over a four year period both in terms of biomass (~50%) and abundance (~81%) (from ~0.5 kilograms or 0.75 individuals per haul in 2007 to ~0.25 kilograms or 0.25 individuals in 2011), although catch rates in the last few years are comparable to those observed at the start of the time-series (ICES 2012). Earlier analyses of Scottish survey data from waters west of Scotland suggested stable or increasing catch trends (ICES 2012), although more recent data were not available. The English and Welsh beam trawl survey in the Irish Sea indicated a decline in mean CPUE of ~42% over 19 years from ~2.4 individuals per hour in 1993 to ~1.4 in 2011, with the mean catch rates from 2010 and 2011 lower than those from 2005 to 2009 (ICES 2012). From the Irish Groundfish Survey of this area, trends in abundance are not apparent, with variable annual catches and a mean CPUE of approximately one individual per hour, falling within the lower margin of the mean CPUE for the period 2005 to 2009 (ICES 2012). </p>  <p>The biomass indices reported by Spanish fishery-independent trawl surveys of Spanish Atlantic waters show annual variation of ~60% between 0.2 and 0.5 kilograms per haul, with an overall increase in catch rates (ICES 2012). Fishery-independent data for Portuguese waters are too limited to gauge longer-term trends.</p>  <p>The landings per unit effort (LPUE) of this skate from the Bay of Biscay between 2002 and 2011 show constant values between 50 and 68 kilograms per day, excluding the lowest values of approximately 34 tonnes overall for 2004 and 48 tonnes in 2010&#160; (ICES 2012). The relationship between Cuckoo Skate populations in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay region is unknown.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This skate appears to have always been relatively uncommon in the Mediterranean Sea; it was rarely caught in the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) from 1994-1999. The MEDITS covers the northern Mediterranean coast almost continuously from west Morocco and Spain in the west, to the Aegean Sea in the east (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001). Six trawl surveys are carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: western (Morocco, Spain, France), western central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), eastern central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and eastern (Aegean Sea). A total of 6,336 tows were performed between 1994 and 1999 at depths ranging from 10-800 m. This species was recorded in only 42 of 6,336 tows during this survey (frequency of occurrence of 1%) and was more frequently captured in the eastern area (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). A time series of comparative trawl surveys in the Gulf of Lions indicate that this skate was historically present in both shelf and slope trawl surveys in 1957-1960 and in 1980-1984 (150-800 m), but was not present on the shelf or slope in comparable surveys in 1992-1995 (Aldebert 1997), indicating local extinction from this area.</p>  <p>This species does not appear to have been captured in historical and recent trawl surveys of the Adriatic Sea (Jukic-Peladic 2001).

Harvest of Horseshoe Crabs for fertilizer declined to a negligible level  by the 1960s (Shuster 2003, Kreamer and Michels 2009).<br/><br/>Presently  the largest coast-wide harvest is for bait. Horseshoe Crabs are  commercially harvested primarily for use as bait in the conch (<em>Busycon</em> spp.) pot and American Eel (<em>Anguilla rostrata</em>)  pot fisheries (ASMFC 2009). The increase in harvest of Horseshoe Crabs  during the 1990s was largely due to increased use as whelk bait (Smith <em>et al</em>.  2009b). Coast-wide landings of all four whelk species have increased  62% since 2005 (ASMFC 2013), although harvest of Horseshoe Crabs for  bait has declined since 1998 through quota regulations and has been  stable since mid-2000s (Table 4 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>Between  1970 and 1990, commercial harvest increased from less than 20,000  pounds (9 mt) to above 2 million pounds (907 mt) annually (ASMFC 2013).  Reported harvest increased rapidly during the late 1990s to nearly 6  million pounds (2,722 mt) or nearly 3 million animals in 1998 (Table 4  in the Supplementary Material). Since the 1998, harvest quotas and  season closures have been set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries  Commission (ASMFC 1998), a marine reserve has been established, and  bait-saving devices have been used widely by commercial fishers. In  recent years, reported bait landings ranged from 600,000 to 750,000  animals and more males have been harvested then females because states  have established sex-specific restrictions designed to reduce harvest of  females (ASMFC 2013).&#160; <br/><br/>Harvest of Horseshoe Crabs in the Gulf  of México is regulated only at the state level. In Northeast Gulf  region, harvesting of Horseshoe Crabs by shrimp trawlers began in the  early 1980s (Rudloe 1982). In 1999 more than 110,000 Horseshoe Crabs  were harvested from the west coast of Florida. In that year, fishermen  were experiencing a bait shortage due to increased regulation of  Horseshoe Crabs in Delaware Bay. Horseshoe Crabs can be an easy source  of money for those willing to collect them off the beaches. Raffield  Fisheries near Port St. Joe, FL estimated that they purchased  approximately 99,000 Horseshoe Crabs in 44 days mostly from unemployed  workers who had been encouraged to collect Horseshoe Crabs for bait  (Wallace 1999). Since 2000 only 14,683 Horseshoe Crabs have been  harvested for bait along the west coast of Florida based on data  compiled from reported trip tickets (Gerhart 2007). Bait harvest in  Florida is regulated and does not present a threat at this time.<br/><br/>Although Horseshoe Crab harvesting is illegal in México due to the species’ risk status (see the <em>Conservation Actions</em>  section below), there are increasing reports of small-scale poaching of  adults by local watermen who set shallow-water nets at the mouths of  coastal lagoons during the incoming phase of the tidal cycle and  hand-pick the animals (J. Zaldívar-Rae, Anáhuac Mayab University, pers.  obs). In Chuburná, Yucatán, this activity coincides with the Horseshoe  Crab spawning season (J. Zaldívar-Rae, Anáhuac Mayab University, pers.  obs.), and anecdotal accounts suggest this harvest occurs in other  localities. Poached Horseshoe Crabs are sold clandestinely and solely  used as an alternative to commercial bait species (<em>Libinia dubia</em> and <em>Cardisoma guanhumi</em> crabs) in the artisanal octopus (<em>Octopus maya</em>)  fishery of Campeche and Yucatán, which takes place between August and  December. Locals state that poaching only occurs when octopus prices in  international markets are low or commercial bait becomes scarce or too  expensive. However, there are also anecdotal reports of a growing demand  for large amounts of Horseshoe Crabs from medium-sized ship operators,  who capture common octopus, <em>Octopus vulgaris</em>, in deeper waters  during weeks-long trips. Poaching, selling and buying Horseshoe Crabs  are Federal felonies under Mexican law and are punished with up to 12  years incarceration and fines of up to US$19,000 (Diario Oficial de la  Federación 2014a).<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Biomedical Harvest</strong><br/></em></u>Horseshoe  Crabs are harvested by the biomedical industry for the manufacture of  LAL, which is used to test for gram-negative bacterial contamination in  injectable drugs and implantable medical devices. The LAL test was  commercialized in the 1970s and is currently the global standard for  screening medical equipment for bacterial contamination (Levin <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Blood  from Horseshoe Crabs for LAL production is obtained by collecting adult  crabs, extracting a portion of their blood, and releasing them alive.  The Federal Drug Administration estimated medical usage increased from  130,000 crabs in 1989 to 260,000 in 1997 (D. Hochstein, Center for  Biologics Evaluation and Research, pers. comm.) with a steady increase  since that time. Five companies harvest Horseshoe Crab for blood to  produce LAL: Associates of Cape Cod (Massachusetts); Limuli Labs (New  Jersey); Lonza (formerly Cambrex Bioscience) (Virginia); Wako Chemicals  (Virginia); and Charles River Laboratories (South Carolina).<br/><br/>The  number of crabs collected and processed by the biomedical industry has  increased over recent years. Based on a review of pertinent studies  (Rudloe 1983, Kurz and James-Pirri 2002, Walls and Berkson 2003, Horton  and Berkson 2006, Leschen and Correia 2010), the ASMFC assumes a 15%  post-release, post-bleeding mortality with a range of 5 to 30% mortality  depending on factors such as volume bled and handling stress. Under  these assumptions, mortality of crabs processed for LAL for 2012 was  79,786 with a range of 31,189 to 152,681 crabs (ASMFC 2013).<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Marine Life and Scientific Collection</strong><br/></em></u>Horseshoe  Crabs are collected for marine life fishery (e.g., aquarium trade) and  for scientific collection. Atlantic states are required to report all  harvest, including harvest for marine life or scientific collection, to  show compliance with the Fishery Management Plan (Marin Hawk, ASMFC,  pers. comm). Monitoring program requirement A1 includes annual report of  “The use and harvest of horseshoe crabs for scientific research,  educational activities, and live trade should also be monitored and must  be reported by all states.” (ASMFC 1998). The recent reporting from  2012 indicates that marine life or scientific collection not associated  with biomedical harvest involves a few permits issued and relatively  small numbers of animals kept (ASMFC 2013). For example in 2012,  Massachusetts reported less than 1,000 collected; Connecticut reported  that collections were for educational purposes and individuals were  returned to open water alive; New Jersey reported a few hundred were  collected and most were returned alive; Delaware reported less than 300  collected mostly for research and education; and North Carolina reported  approximately 500 collected with half returned alive. The exception is  Florida where the marine life fishery is substantial and may be  expanding on the west coast, but may be declining on the east coast  (Florida harvest data file compiled from trip tickets). On the east  coast since 2008 (most recent five years) a mean of 109 trips have  collected a mean of 4,938 animals per year (mean 45.3 animals per trip).  Although these numbers are small and have declined substantially since  2004, the east coast populations of Horseshoe Crabs are small and could  be affected significantly by this harvest. On the west coast since 2008  (most recent five years) a mean of 264 collecting trips have been made  annually with a mean of 22,597 animals collected per year (mean 85.5  animals per trip). The magnitude of the threat from marine-life fishery  is unknown because population size is unknown (Gerhart 2007). However,  approximately half of reported marine-life landings of Horseshoe Crabs  are from the Florida Keys (49%; FWC online survey) which have relatively  low numbers of Horseshoe Crabs and where there is a relative dearth of  suitable adult spawning habitat. If the current population abundance is  indeed low, extensive removal of largely first or second-year juveniles  due to marine-life landings could hamper the ability of the population  to sustain itself (Gerhart 2007).<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Bycatch</strong><br/></em></u>Historically, Horseshoe Crabs have been considered a non-target bycatch in commercial  fisheries targeted at other species and returned to the water (Walls <em>et  al</em>. 2002). However, injuries can occur during capture, and these  injuries can lead to mortality or altered fitness. Horseshoe Crabs were  the most abundant invertebrate bycatch species caught in shrimp trawls  in Tampa Bay; 2,867 Horseshoe Crabs were caught during two sampling  seasons with the largest catches in the fall (Steele <em>et al</em>. 2002). As  part of a tagging study during which Horseshoe Crabs were caught using  dredges (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2006), injury rate was 11% (4,459 out of 39,343;  D. Smith, USGS, unpub. data). A subjective assessment was that 6%  of the total catch (i.e., 2,542 out of 39,343) was severe enough to cause  mortality. These injury and mortality rates would apply to bycatch when  dredges are used to harvest whelk and to some extent when bottom trawls  are used to harvest horseshoe crabs for LAL production. Many Horseshoe Crabs are damaged by hydraulic dredging for Surf Clams (<em>Spisula  solidissima</em>) off the Atlantic coast of New Jersey (M. Botton, Fordham  University, pers. obs). The significance to population  viability depends on the magnitude of bycatch mortality relative to  population size and natural mortality. As with any ancillary threat to Horseshoe Crabs, the importance will be greater for a small population  restricted to a single embayment than for a large migratory population.<br/><br/>Horseshoe Crabs may have been a common bycatch species of shrimp trawlers in the  southern Gulf of México, especially during the 1970s to 1980s, when this  fishery experienced a boom in Campeche and few controls on bycatch were  in place. However, in a study of bycatch composition among artisanal  trawlers fishing Atlantic Seabob (<em>Xiphopenaeus kroyeri</em>) in areas within  the Laguna de Términos where Horseshoe Crabs are common, they were not  among the invertebrates caught with prawn (Wakida-Kusunoki 2005)<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Habitat Loss</strong><br/></em></u>Undisturbed sandy beach is considered to be optimal spawning habitat (Botton <em>et al</em>. 1988), and the availability of optimal spawning habitat is considered to be a limiting factor on population growth (Rudloe 1982, ASMFC 1998). Botton <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported that only 10.6% of Delaware Bay shore on the New Jersey side was optimal spawning habitat. Beach erosion and human development are coast-wide concerns for conservation of beach habitat for Horseshoe Crabs (Jackson and Nordstrom 2009). Loss of sand to erosion exposes parent material, such as peat or fine-grained mud, which tend to be anoxic or low oxygen environments unsuitable for egg development (Botton <em>et al</em>. 1988, Penn and Brockmann 1994, Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2008). Human development <em>per se</em> is not necessarily a threat because Horseshoe Crabs will spawn on beaches in front of houses and do not avoid human activity. Some of the best beach habitat with the densest spawning occurs on sandy barriers associated with coastal development (Jackson and Nordstrom 2009). However, beach driving, which is permitted on some beaches, can result in crushing of stranded Horseshoe Crabs. Shoreline change is a function of both coastal geomorphology and human development, and the purpose of erosion control is mainly to protect human structures (Hapke <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hardening the shoreline as a means of erosion control can result in the loss of habitat suitable for Horseshoe Crab spawning and egg development. Protecting sandy barriers with hard structures, e.g., bulkheads and rip rap, can result in loss of habitat for spawning and egg development by truncating the beach foreshore and creating structures that trap spawning Horseshoe Crabs and increase stranding mortality. Jackson <em>et al</em>. (2015) reported that 40% of shoreline within five New Jersey spawning beaches was fragmented by bulkhead segments and enclaves. Further, between 20 to 100% of bulkheads intersected below the spring wrack line, which directly constricts spawning (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2015). In contrast, protection or restoration of coastal ecosystems can serve the purpose of reducing risk to vulnerable property (Arkema <em>et al</em>. 2013). For example, beach replenishment can restore or maintain quality habitat (Jackson and Nordstrom 2009), if designed to match natural sediment characteristics (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2005a, 2005b, and 2007), maintain sediment transport (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2010), and avoid adverse effects on early life stages and on reproduction through project location and timing.<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Impingement on Coastal Infrastructure </strong><br/></em></u>There has not been a comprehensive assessment of the extent of coastline with infrastructure at risk for impingement. Within Delaware Bay, Botton <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated that 10% of New Jersey shoreline was severely affected by bulkheading, and more recent estimates indicate the influence of bulkheading along the New Jersey bay shore has increased (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although bulkheading was eliminated from the Delaware shoreline, extensive impingement has been observed at breakwaters formed by rip rap and road overwash at Mispillion Harbor and Port Mahon (D. Smith, USGS, pers. obs). Mitigation measures at power plants have been successful at reducing impingement (see Connecticut’s example in the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section); however, not all power plants within horseshoe crab habitat have been assessed for impingement risk.<br/><br/>In a study of impingement at two power plants on the Indian River a total of 39,097 Horseshoe Crabs were trapped on the intake screens at the Florida Power and Light Cape Canaveral Plant (FPL) and 53,121 at the Orlando Utilities Commission Indian River Plant (OUC) over the 12-month period of the study (Applied Biology Inc., 1980). A previous study conducted in 1975 estimated 69,662 at FPL and 104,000 Horseshoe Crabs were retained annually at the FPL and OUC intakes. This level of mortality can be a major threat to a localized population (Ehlinger and Tankersley 2007).<br/><br/>Solutions to minimize entrapment and mortality have been engineered for some existing and new power plants. For example, through a federally approved National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permitting program pursuant to the section 316(b) of the federal Clean Water Act, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection has required the design and installation of Aquatic Organism Return Systems (AORS) in order to minimize the mortality of aquatic organisms, including horseshoe crabs (Mark Johnson, CT DEEP, pers. comm). Although the level of historical mortality is not known, from the 1970s through the 1990s it is likely that annual mortality of Horseshoe Crabs was in the low thousands. Horseshoe Crabs entered the cooling water intake forebays, climbed on to the intake travelling screens, and ultimately wound up in debris collection pits or baskets where many of them died. The retrofitted AORS returned the Horseshoe Crabs alive to the water body. Narrowing the spacing between the bars of trash racks in front of the intake was another measure that kept many Horseshoe Crabs from passing through to the intake screens. One power plant required periodic monitoring and removal of sediment accumulation near the intake structure to minimize trapping of Horseshoe Crabs. Collectively, these measures have largely eliminated Horseshoe Crab mortality and other negative effects at Connecticut’s coastal power plants.<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Water Quality and Pollution Events </strong><br/></em></u>Botton and Itow (2009) reviewed studies on water quality and contaminant effects on Horseshoe Crab embryos and larvae. They concluded that current levels of contamination and water quality do not pose a population-level effect for <em>L. polyphemus</em>. They reached a different conclusion for <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em> an Asian species in Japan where they believe pollution is contributing to population decline. Eutrophication due to excess nutrient loading, particularly nitrogen from anthropogenic sources on adjacent watersheds, is pervasive among coastal systems where Horseshoe Crabs reside. While nutrient enrichment and source shifts are known to affect Horseshoe Crab food web dynamics, these factors do not appear to have a major effect on Horseshoe Crab abundance and distribution where effects have been studied (O’Connell <em>et al</em>. 2003, Carmichael <em>et al</em>. 2004). As a result, unique dietary signatures (based on stable isotope values) have been useful to demonstrate that Horseshoe Crabs show loyalty to local habitat sites and associated food resources, regardless of level of eutrophication. Oil spills represent an acute threat, which depends on timing, magnitude, wind pattern, oil type, and factors that contribute to bioremediation (Venosa <em>et al</em>. 1996). Although there has been a history of oil spills in Delaware Bay, which is a major seaway for transport of oil (Botton and Itow 2009), the effect on the Horseshoe Crab population has not been evident largely because the timing and spatial extent of the spills have not overlapped with Horseshoe Crab spawning. However, an oil spill that coincided with spawning activity with oil washed onto spawning beaches could be catastrophic to a local population (Venosa <em>et al</em>. 1996). In addition to the obvious effect of oil coated animals, studies have examined effects of oil on growth and survival of eggs and early life stages. Laughlin and Neff (1977) observed reduced hatching success in horseshoe crab eggs exposed to 50% water-soluble fraction of No. 2 fuel oil and metabolic stress among 2nd instars at lower concentrations (5 to 10% water-soluble fraction). Oil that does not reach the beaches during spawning and is not collected will weather and lose volatile compounds (Strobel and Brenowitz 1981). The heavier oil that remains has been shown to affect development and survival with a minimum lethal dose of 2.25 mg/l in suspension (Strobel and Brenowitz 1981). A study lead by Ruth Carmichael (Dauphin Island Sea Lab, pers. comms) examined potential effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWHOS) on young Horseshoe Crabs within the northern Gulf of Mexico (Estes <em>et al</em>. 2015). Comparison of molt patterns (size and timing) at Petit Bios Island, Mississippi before and following the DWHOS indicated no evidence of adverse effect to subadult survival.&#160; However, they lacked evidence to make inference about effects on spawning adults or population level effects.<br/><br/>“Possible reasons for the decline or small population size of horseshoe crabs in Indian River Lagoon (IRL) include changes in water quality, loss of habitat and increased human harvest. A 188% increase in the human population adjacent to the IRL from 1970 to 1990 resulted in significant decline in water quality, an increase in the prevalence of anoxic sediments and altered sediment composition along the shoreline (Woodward-Clyde 1994). The build-up of muck and anoxic sediments along the shoreline as a result of increased runoff may have reduced areas of optimal spawning habitat…Creation of impoundments around the IRL in the 1960s drastically reduced horizontal and vertical diversity of the shoreline suitable for spawning and nesting.“ (Ehlinger and Tankersley&#160; 2007).<br/><br/>Red tides are harmful algal blooms caused by abnormally high concentrations of dinoflagellates. Red tides caused by <em>Karenia brevis</em> are common in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of México, particularly southwest Florida and in the Yucatán Peninsula where Horseshoe Crabs are common. Periodic red tides occur along Florida’s west coast and young Horseshoe Crabs are one of the affected species (Galtsoff 1949). A major die-off of horseshoe crabs occurred in the Indian River Lagoon in July 1999. An estimated 100,000 adult <em>L. polyphemus</em> died in the northern part of the Indian River and the southern portion of Mosquito Lagoon (Scheidt and Lowers 2001). However, no other species were affected; thus, algal blooms or pollution leading to low oxygen or low water quality probably did not cause the die off.<br/>In Yucatán, red tides are common, with the latest events taking place in 2003, 2008 and 2011. These last occurrences were due to blooms of <em>Scripsiella trochoidea</em>, <em>Cylindrotheca clostridium</em> and <em>Nitzchia longissima</em>, although other species were also detected (Ortegón <em>et al</em>. 2011, Herrera <em>et al</em>. 2010). There are reports of severe impacts of harmful algal blooms on commercially important fish and benthic organisms such as octopus, <em>O. maya</em>, and sea cucumbers, <em>Isostichopus badionotus</em> in the northern coast of Yucatán (Zetina <em>et al</em>. 2009), but effects on Horseshoe Crabs, although likely, have not been measured.<br/><br/><u><em><strong>Climate Change </strong><br/></em></u><em>Limulus </em>adults, as well as embryos and larvae, are eurythermal (Botton and Itow 2009), so direct mortally from rising water temperatures is probably less of a threat to the species than sea level rise. The obvious threat from climate change to coastal habitat is the loss of spawning habitat due to sea level rise and storms (Arkema <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sea-level rise will increase the rate at which these habitats disappear, and it will increase the likelihood that Horseshoe Crab spawning habit becomes compressed between the rising sea and existing housing and other infrastructure (Loveland and Botton 2015). Over the last century, sea level has risen by 20-40 cm depending on where you are on the coast, due to sea level rise and local sinking of land. Along the Florida shore, the sea level is rising 2.5 cm every 11-14 years. Other effects of climate change, such as increasing water temperatures and altered storm frequency and severity, could affect timing of spawning activity in some regions. Changes in timing of spawning activity would have uncertain consequences to Horseshoe Crab population viability, but could have ecosystem effects by creating mismatches in predator-prey dynamics, particularly those involving shorebirds and horseshoe crab eggs (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2011a, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2011).","<strong>Harvest management</strong><br/><br/><strong><em>Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission Management Plan</em></strong><br/>As described above, <em>L. polyphemus</em> is harvested primarily for two purposes: (1) as bait for commercial fisheries and (2) for collection of their blood for use in the biomedical industry. The bait harvest along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. is regulated by the ASMFC. The mission of the ASMFC is to promote “better utilization of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard by the development of a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries, and by the prevention of physical waste of the fisheries from any cause”. The ASMFC serves as the deliberative body that coordinates the conservation and management of the shared near-shore fishery resources, and is comprised of the 15 Atlantic coast states, as well as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Each state is responsible for implementing management measures in its jurisdiction in a manner consistent with the regulations set forth in the ASMFC Interstate Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP; ASMFC 1998) and associated addendums, with the caveat that the States can always implement more conservative measures should they desire.<br/><br/>A management board exists for each of the species under management by the ASMFC and is responsible for developing and implementing a management plans for the species. To do so, the management board relies on input from technical committees and an advisory panel. A Horseshoe Crab Technical Committee and a Delaware Bay Ecosystem Technical Committee were formed to provide scientific advice to the Horseshoe Crab Management Board. These technical committees are composed of technical staff from states involved in the ASMFC, as well as representatives from NMFS, USFWS, and members of academia. They assess and interpret relevant data on <em>Limulus </em>and associated shorebirds, analyse the likely impacts of possible management actions, and make science-based recommendations to the Management Board.<br/><br/>The ASMFC Horseshoe Crab Management Board developed an IFMP for Limulus in October 1998 (ASMFC 1998), and seven Addenda have been approved since then to reflect improved understanding of exploitation and population dynamics. The <em>Limulus</em> management plan explicitly incorporates objectives for both sustainable prosecution of the fishery as well as continued function in the trophic ecology of coastal systems, i.e., use by migratory shorebirds and sea turtles. The migratory shorebirds that utilize Delaware Bay as a critical stopover includes the federally threatened red knot (FWS–R5–ES–2013–0097, <a href=""""http://www.fws.gov/northeast/redknot/pdf/2014_28338_fedregisterfinalrule.pdf"""">http://www.fws.gov/northeast/redknot/pdf/2014_28338_fedregisterfinalrule.pdf</a>). Beginning in 2000, harvest of <em>Limulu</em>s was managed by a quota system for each Atlantic coast state, based on an across-the-board reduction from an established reference period landing (Table 4 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The harvest quotas established by ASMFC govern state-specific harvest regulations (Table 4 in the Supplementary Material), although individual states have the option of imposing more conservative measures. The Delaware Bay states have had the most complex regulatory history because of the link between horseshoe crabs and shorebirds within Delaware Bay. Delaware Bay harvest regulations are summarized following a bulleted summary of state-specific regulations for the non-Delaware Bay states.<br/><ul><li>Maine prohibits harvest from May 1 to October 30, but allows harvested American Horseshoe Crabs to be imported from other jurisdictions, as long as the origin is documented. Maine’s daily limit is 25 horseshoe crabs per person per day, but imported animals are not subject to this limitation (Eckel <em>et al</em>. 2010). A permit to harvest is required in Maine.</li></ul><ul><li>New Hampshire limits Horseshoe Crab takings to 10 a day and requires reporting and a harvest permit.</li></ul><ul><li>Massachusetts has implemented a harvest quota of 165,000, approximately half of that allowed under the state’s ASMFC quota.&#160; Over the 5-year period from 2008 to 2012, approximately 30% of the coastal harvest, outside of the four Delaware Bay states, has occurred in Massachusetts. Massachusetts can close any area to Horseshoe Crab harvesting, and adjust the manner and times of taking, legal size limits, numbers and/or quantities. The state can close and open commercial harvest depending on the current proportion of the annual quota already taken. Existing harvest permits which are not renewed are forfeited, and new permits are not issued, except for special use permits for biomedical purposes only. Biomedical harvest permit holders must sell horseshoe crabs only to authorized dealers, and return all horseshoe crabs not used for display or research, other than bleeding, alive to the area of capture. Horseshoe Crabs purchased by a biomedical company from bait dealers must be documented and tracked, and may be returned to bait dealers to be sold as bait (Eckel <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li></ul><ul><li>Rhode Island has set an annual harvest quota of 14,655 animals, which is approximately 55% of the quota allowed under ASMFC regulations. Over the 5-year period from 2008 to 2012, approximately 5% of the coastal harvest, outside of the four Delaware Bay states, occurred in Rhode Island. A permit is required for commercial harvest. Crabs taken for the biomedical industry must be returned to their source waters within 72 hours of the completion of the biomedical procedure.</li></ul><ul><li>Connecticut’s annual harvest quota is set by ASMFC at 48,689 animals, although their 5-year average harvest from 2008 to 2012 was only 55% of their allowed quota. Over that same 5-year period, approximately 9% of the coastal harvest, outside of the four Delaware Bay states, has occurred in Connecticut. The state enforces seasonal and areal closures, and both a permit and an endorsement letter are required for harvest. Endorsement letters can only be obtained by those on record for possessing a harvest permit between 1999 and 2006. Connecticut established three areas closed to harvest in 2007 in order to maximize horseshoe crab egg availability to the shorebirds using those areas.</li></ul><ul><li>New York has implemented an annual harvest quota of 170,000 Horseshoe Crabs, which is approximately 46% of the quota allowed under ASMFC regulations. A permit is required for commercial harvesters, and the state has implemented seasonal gear restrictions and areal closures to protect spawning stocks. Over the 5-year period from 2008 to 2012, New York has harvested an average of 142,380 Horseshoe Crabs, which is the second largest average harvest among all states in that 5-year period. It also represents 48% of the coastal harvest outside of the four Delaware Bay states. <br/></li></ul><ul><li>North Carolina has a quota of about 24,000, which has not changed since the reference period landings. Harvest is limited to no more than 50 per trip.</li></ul><ul><li>The historically small harvest of crabs in the Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto Basin in South Carolina was eliminated in 1991 and at this time any harvest of Horseshoe Crabs for the bait industry is prohibited. The harvest of Horseshoe Crabs is now limited to the LAL industry, and a permit has been required since 1991. Horseshoe Crabs used in the biomedical industry may have up to 1/3 of their blood extracted and then must be returned unharmed to state waters of comparable salinity and water quality as soon as possible unless subsequent retention is permitted (Eckel <em>et al</em>. 2010). Horseshoe Crabs from which blood is collected for production of LAL may be held in facilities approved by the state and must be handled so as to minimize injury to the crab. Crabs taken incidentally during legal fishing operations are not penalized as long as the crabs are returned immediately to the water unharmed. The state may grant permits to institutions and persons engaged in science instruction or curation to possess no more than five horseshoe crabs or parts.</li></ul><ul><li>Horseshoe Crabs can only be taken from Georgia’s saltwaters that are open for the taking of shrimp, whelk, or blue crab by trawling. The interstate import of horseshoe crabs is allowed, providing that a bill of landing accompanies the horseshoe crabs as proof that they were not taken or transported in violation of state laws. Limits are twenty-five for an individual or seventy-five on a boat, whichever is less. If Horseshoe Crabs are taken for biomedical use they must be returned unharmed to state waters of comparable salinity and water quality as soon as is feasible after any blood collection. (Eckel <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li></ul><ul><li>In March 2000 a fisheries management plan for horseshoe crabs went into effect in Florida based on Florida statutes, which set the bait harvest quota at 9,455. There are two types of permits, a saltwater products license with a marine life endorsement and a commercial eel license. There is a daily limit of 25 Horseshoe Crabs per person (bag or possession; hand harvest only). With a commercial saltwater products license a person can harvest (or possess) up to 100 per day (Florida Statute). The same regulations hold for a commercial eel license. All Florida wholesale dealers, and retailers who collect their own product, must submit a trip ticket for each trip during which saltwater products are collected. Trip tickets are submitted to FWC and the data are entered into FWC’s Marine Fisheries Information System (Gerhart 2007). In July 2002 an amendment to the horseshoe crab management plan went into effect establishing licensing for the biomedical use of Horseshoe Crabs. A Horseshoe Crab Biomedical Collecting Permit allows for the temporary holding of Horseshoe Crabs to collect blood and there are a number of handling and reporting provisions associated with this license (Eckel <em>et al</em>. 2010; FWC Fishery). Horseshoe Crabs are monitored through trawl sampling and a voluntary on-line reporting system. The Florida FWC has discussed whether marine-life landings should be included in the quotas allotted to each state. If this happened and marine-life landings remained at current levels, Florida would exceed its quota and be out of compliance with the IFMP. With the current bag limit of 100 Horseshoe Crabs per day, the quota could be exceeded after only 95 trips (Gerhart 2007).<br/></li></ul><strong><em>Delaware Bay states</em></strong> — Since adoption of ASMFC IFMP in 1998, a series of increasingly conservative sex-specific harvest quotas and seasonal restrictions were implemented for the four states surrounding Delaware Bay, i.e., Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia.&#160;&#160; New Jersey instituted a complete moratorium on harvesting Limulus from state waters in 2006, and this ban remains in effect to the current date. In February 2012, the ASMFC <em>Limulus</em> Management Board approved Addendum VII, which provides for managing harvest of Delaware Bay-origin animals via an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) framework, wherein annual harvest is derived via a suite of multi-species models and an optimization process which takes into account many biological variables, including the status of the <em>Limulus</em> population and the red knot population (ASMFC 2009, McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2011b). The ARM framework also defines monitoring programs and procedures to update the modelling structure and parameterization, and uncertainty is incorporated throughout the framework. The ARM framework provides managers a recommended harvest which seeks to maximize harvest numbers with the constraint that harvest occurs only after accepted thresholds for the <em>C. c. rufa</em> population and <em>Limulus</em> reproductive capacities have been attained. The US FWS notes the adoption of the ARM framework that explicitly links harvest to Red Knot population growth as the reason they do not consider the HSC harvest to be a current threat to Red Knot persistence (<a href=""""http://www.fws.gov/northeast/redknot/pdf/2014_28338_fedregisterfinalrule.pdf"""">http://www.fws.gov/northeast/redknot/pdf/2014_28338_fedregisterfinalrule.pdf</a>). The harvest alternatives from which the ARM framework determines an optimum range from no harvest whatsoever to a maximum of 420,000 males and 210,000 females. The total harvest for <em>Limulus</em> from Delaware Bay, prescribed by the ARM process, is allocated among the four bay-area States via an algorithm based in part on the likely proportion of each state’s catch being animals of Delaware Bay origin.<br/><br/>Harvest quotas for the four Delaware Bay states in 2013 and 2014, as recommended by the ARM process and adopted by ASMFC, are provided in Table 5 in the Supplementary Material. A moratorium on harvest remains in effect in New Jersey.<br/><br/>In an effort to further ensure a sustainable Horseshoe Crab population in the mid-Atlantic region, NMFS established a 3,885 km² no-take zone in Federal waters outside the mouth of Delaware Bay (Figure 4 in the Supplementary Material). Harvest or possession of Horseshoe Crabs aboard vessels within the Carl N. Shuster Jr. Horseshoe Crab Reserve is prohibited and this area is known to have very large concentrations of Horseshoe Crabs (Botton and Haskin 1984, Botton and Ropes 1987). An exempted fishing permit for capture of crabs in the Reserve for biomedical purposes has been issued to Limuli Laboratories Inc. by NMFS since 2001. The permit allows the capture of up to 10,000 animals annually, and requires the permittee to collect demographic and morphometric data on the collected animals.<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Gulf of México Region<br/></strong></em>Commercial harvest of <em>Limulus</em> in the Gulf of México waters of the U.S. is limited due to their relatively low abundance. Currently, horseshoe crab harvest in the Gulf of México is not addressed by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission (GSMFC) although they have discussed the need for regulations. Florida‘s regulations, which apply to both the Atlantic and Gulf sides of the state, control harvest of Horseshoe Crabs for commercial use and the “marine life” trade via daily bag limits. Management of Horseshoe Crabs on the west coast involves the same regulations as those on the east coast (with no bait harvest quota).&#160; No other Gulf state regulates harvest of horseshoe crabs.<br/><br/><strong><em>Yucatán Region</em></strong><br/>As for all species in the “en peligro de extinción” or “amenazada” protection categories (see below), harvesting of Horseshoe Crabs is forbidden by federal law in México, unless it is proven that a) harvesting quotas are below levels that allow the natural replenishment of the harvested wild population, or b) they are the result of controlled reproduction, in the case of captive organisms, or c) when the use of parts or tissues is involved, it will not negatively affect the population or modify the specimens’ life cycle, or d) when the collection of derivatives from specimens is involved, loss of these derivatives or the procedure used to collect them will not permanently harm specimens (Diario Oficial de la Federación 2014b). In addition, should harvested specimens or their parts and derivatives come from wild populations, it must be proven that controlled reproduction programs are in place to replenish these populations. In case harvested specimens come from captive populations, controlled reproduction of specimens in these populations must support governmental programs aimed at replenishing wild populations (Diario Oficial de la Federación 2014b). Currently, there are no legal Horseshoe Crab harvesting operations in México. However, as mentioned above, there is a seasonal clandestine market for Horseshoe Crabs as bait, fuelled by small-scale poaching. So far, this illegal trade has not been addressed by either local or Federal authorities.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Alternative Bait Strategies</strong><br/>Innovative efforts to reduce the quantity of Horseshoe Crabs required to meet the demand for the bait industry have produced some gains.&#160; Beginning in 1999, the fishing industry began to adopt the use of bait bags, wherein smaller portions of Horseshoe Crabs could be used as bait in a single conch pot, as opposed to a whole animal. This practice has expanded along the coast and resulted in more efficient use of Horseshoe Crabs as bait for the conch fishery.<br/><br/>An alternative bait, which chemically mimics the Horseshoe Crab, has been developed and was commercially marketed for the first time in 2013 (Wakefield 2013). Preparation of the bait by individuals is also possible via a published recipe. The product is a result of years of research by a team of researchers from the University of Delaware. While the product contains Horseshoe Crab tissue in its formulation, the amount is small enough such that widespread use of the artificial bait would significantly reduce bait harvest. Currently, it remains uncertain whether the fishing industry will widely adopt the artificial bait.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Law Enforcement<br/></strong>Increased prices and reduced availability of <em>Limulus</em> in the U.S. bait trade has motivated dealers to import Asian Horseshoe Crab species (<em>Carcinscorpius rotundicauda</em>, <em>Tachypleus gigas</em>, <em>Tachypleus tridentatus</em>) for use as bait in the domestic conch and eel fisheries. These importations are viewed as a significant threat to native <em>Limulus</em> populations due to possible introductions of harmful parasites and pathogens into U.S. waters (Appendix). In addition, <em>C. rotundicauda </em>is known to accumulate tetrodotoxin, and concerns that eel and whelk may accumulate this potentially lethal neurotoxin argue against continued importation of Asian species. For these reasons, many individual states have implemented regulations, or initiated the regulatory processes, to prohibit possession Asian species and/or their use as bait in their fisheries. The U.S. Congress is deliberating on legislation that would expand the reach of the federal government for designating non-native species as invasive or injurious and prohibiting their importation. The applicable statute (Lacey Act) presently applies to various taxa, including crustaceans, but not to chelicerates. While long-term harmful effects can result from relatively few or isolated introductions, it appears the threat posed by importation of Asian species is being addressed as expediently as possible.<br/><br/>Increased prices for <em>Limulus</em> in the bait market may also be responsible for increased incidences of illegal harvest. Charges were brought in two cases of illegal harvest in New York waters in the summer of 2013. The amount of illegal harvest in the mid-Atlantic region is unknown, although awareness by enforcement authorities is increasing (Goodman and Nir 2013).<br/><br/>In 1994, Horseshoe Crabs in México were assigned the status “en peligro de extinción” (literally, “in danger of extinction”), the highest risk category for extant species in the Mexican Official Standard for Mexican species at risk (NOM-059-ECOL-1994; SEDESOL 1994). Under that Standard, a species is assigned such status if&#160; “its distribution or population size have drastically decreased, putting its biological viability at risk throughout its range, as a result of the destruction or drastic modification of its habitat, severe restriction of its distribution, over-exploitation, disease, and predation, among other causes” (SEDESOL 1994). This risk category overlaps IUCN’s “Critically Endangered” and “Endangered” categories, and its definition is still in place (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>It is unclear which of the “en peligro de extinción” criteria were deemed to be met in the case of Mexican Horseshoe Crabs, but it is known that in the 1994 NOM-059 exercise some species were included in the endangered species list purely on the basis of qualitative impressions and the individual interests of invited experts (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2007). There have been subsequent revisions of inclusion criteria to the NOM-059 standard (e.g. NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001; NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010; SEMARNAT 2002, 2010) and an objective risk assessment procedure (the “Method for the assessment of extinction risk of Mexican wildlife species”, MER; Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2007) has been introduced, but to this day Mexican Horseshoe Crab populations have not been officially subjected to this procedure. Nevertheless, when the MER procedure was established it was decided that the status of no species in the NOM-059-ECOL-1994 list would be modified if data were not sufficient to apply the MER (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2007). Hence, <em>L. polyphemus</em> is still regarded as “en peligro de extinción”.<br/><br/>The MER includes four criteria with a variable number of levels, each affording 1 to 4 points to a general score: a) amplitude of the species’ distribution in México (4 levels, 1-4 points, respectively: wide, moderately restricted, narrow and very narrow); b) condition of the habitat (3 levels, 1-3 points: favourable, intermediate, hostile/very limiting); c) intrinsic species vulnerability on the basis of its biology and life history traits (3 levels, 1-3 points: low, medium, high); and d) impact of human activity on the species (3 levels, 2-4 points: low, medium and high) (SEMARNAT 2010; Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to these criteria applied as an informal assessment, horseshoe crabs in México have a restricted distribution (5-15% of the Mexican Exclusive Economic Zone; 3 points); arguably, their habitats are in intermediate condition (coastal lagoons conditions vary widely from almost pristine to severely disturbed; 2 points); and human activities can exert medium to high impacts on these habitats, through water and sediment pollution and encroachment or modification of land use in sites adjacent to coastal lagoons (3 to 4 points). Thus far, information on the biological features of the species in México is not enough to establish how vulnerable Mexican populations of Horseshoe Crab may be. However, the only formal quantitative survey of spawning events carried out so far in a Mexican locality, has revealed that abundances of reproductive individuals are relatively low: spawning pairs do not exceed the tens of pairs in a 100 m transect on a peak high tide (J. Gutiérrez and J. Zaldívar-Rae, Anáhuac Mayab University, unpub. data) and reports by locals from other sites suggest that this may be the case throughout most of the distribution in México (J. Zaldívar-Rae, Anáhuac Mayab University, pers. obs). Moreover, spawning seems to be restricted to particular shore conditions within coastal lagoons, so the availability of suitable spawning habitat may also be limited. Based on these elements, the degree of vulnerability of the species may be regarded as medium to high (2 to 3 points). Adding up points in this informal assessment following MER criteria indicates that horseshoe crabs in México should either remain in the “en peligro de extinción” category (12-14 MER points) or at least in the “amenazada” (“threatened”) category (10-11 MER points).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Habitat-Based Conservation Actions</strong><br/>The creation, restoration, or protection of beach or nearshore habitat specifically for the benefit of Horseshoe Crab populations is not common throughout the Atlantic coast. The beach replenishment or fill activities, which occur in several states (e.g., Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts), are generally justified and pursued for protection of communities and infrastructure, particularly for beaches damaged by storm erosion. A desired result is that these projects also augment horseshoe crab spawning habitat. One notable success is Maryland’s primary Horseshoe Crab spawning Island, which has been replenished with dredge spoils since 2010. This activity has almost doubled the available primary habitat for Horseshoe Crabs spawning in the state and thousands of Horseshoe Crabs have been documented spawning on the Island since that time. Both migratory shorebirds and horseshoe crabs have responded favourably to the replenishment action. Jackson and Nordstrom (2009) outline a management framework for conserving shoreline habitat for Horseshoe Crabs. Although the framework is designed for Delaware Bay, the general principles they follow apply range-wide.<br/><br/>There are no management programs specifically focused on Horseshoe Crabs along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast or in México. Neither are there habitat conservation programs explicitly aimed at the species. However, large portions of coastal habitats in the Yucatán Peninsula, including coastal lagoons where Horseshoe Crabs are common and have been reported to reproduce, are under the jurisdiction of both federal and state protected areas with different legal regimes. Although none of the management programs of these protected areas include actions to protect Horseshoe Crabs, protected area administrations pay particular attention and devote considerable efforts to the monitoring and preservation of mangrove forests. This monitoring effort is the result of an amendment to the Federal Law for Wildlife passed in 2007 that forbids and severely punishes any activities that may negatively affect mangrove forests and related ecosystems in Mexico (Diario Oficial de la Federación 2014a, b). In fact, 76.3%, 90.4% and 79% of mangrove forests in Yucatán, Campeche and Quintana Roo, respectively, have been estimated to be within the limits of a federal or state protected area (CONABIO 2009), and hence these ecosystems are subject to management programs. Given that all protected coastal lagoons in the Yucatán Peninsula harbour mangrove forests, it can be said that in México there is at least a legal framework and actions are being taken that incidentally conserve critical habitats for Horseshoe Crabs.",Decreasing,"<em><strong>Population Genetic Structure</strong></em><br/>Due to their morphological similarity to mid-Mesozoic taxa, Horseshoe Crabs are considered to be evolutionarily static and have been referred to as phylogenetic relics (Selander <em>et al</em>. 1970). However, close inspection has revealed the presence of considerable variability and geographic differentiation in morphology (Shuster 1979, Riska 1981) and genetic diversity (Selander <em>et al</em>. 1970, King <em>et al</em>. 2005). A range of molecular genetic techniques applied across multiple studies has been utilized in attempts to assess population structure (stock identification) in Horseshoe Crabs. These studies, which now include the first range-wide surveys of nuclear DNA variation in any Horseshoe Crab (Xiphosura: Limulidae), did not support the null hypothesis of a homogeneous gene pool for Horseshoe Crabs inhabiting the Atlantic coast of North America. The pattern of genetic variation observed was consistent with that identified previously in surveys of morphological variation (Shuster 1979, Riska 1981).<br/><br/>A survey of allozyme variation among four broadly distributed collections suggested that Atlantic and Gulf of México populations of Horseshoe Crabs were genetically differentiated (Selander <em>et al</em>. 1970). A subsequent study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation identified a major genetic discontinuity distinguishing northern from southern populations with a phylogeographic break occurring around Cape Canaveral, along Florida’s Atlantic coast (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1986). At a finer scale, Pierce <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported little evidence of gene flow between Delaware and Chesapeake Bay Horseshoe Crab populations as reflected by sequence variation in the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I region, though variation at randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was uniform, implying that gene flow may be sex-biased. Most recently King <em>et al</em>. (2005 and 2015) have surveyed neutral (assumed) genetic variation at 13 microsatellite DNA markers of 1,841 Horseshoe Crabs sampled at 35 spawning locations (Table 1 in the supplementary material) from northern Maine to the Yucatán Peninsula, México. This extensive intraspecific examination of the nuclear genome (nDNA) has revealed the presence of considerable allelic diversity and differentiation (population structuring) that appears to reflect the actions of various evolutionary processes.<br/><br/>These recent findings (King <em>et al</em>. 2005 and 2015) suggested the presence of similar levels of genetic diversity and variation among the collections punctuated with a series of genetic discontinuities of varying “depth” across the species’ range that could indicate demographic independence, regional adaptation, and reflect vicariant geographic events. Populations sampled within these regional groupings exhibited shallow but statistically significant differentiation.&#160; Moreover, patterns of population relatedness were consistent with the observation that populations at both ends of the species’ range are more differentiated from proximal populations than those in the middle (or zone of abundance).<br/><br/>Patterns of genotypic variation in the nDNA at the individual and population scales suggest three major zones of genetic discontinuity: 1) the Southeast (and northward) from the Florida Atlantic (Florida Indian River [FIR] and Biscayne Bay (FBB]) collections; 2) the Florida Atlantic (to the southern tip of Florida) from the Florida Gulf of México collections; and 3) the Florida Gulf of México from the Yucatán, México collections (Figures 1 and 3, Table 1 in the supplementary material). The latter discontinuity was identified using collections from a single locality on the northeast coast of the Yucatán Peninsula (San Felipe-Río Lagartos); hence, there may be other zones of genetic discontinuity within the Mexican part of the distribution. Narrower zones of genetic discontinuity were evident between a) the Gulf of Maine and Mid-Atlantic collections, b) the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast collections (SC and GA), and c) the Tampa Bay and Cedar Key collections. An additional zone of discontinuity may exist between Alligator Point and St. Joseph Bay along the Florida panhandle. The relatively small sample size from St. Joseph Bay precludes a determination at this time. This phylogeographic pattern implies there are at least seven demographically distinct lineages across the species’ range that are relevant in conservation considerations. In addition to support for recognition of these zones of discontinuity, these data suggest low levels of gene exchange between collections on either side of these genetic discontinuities. Additional data across the Gulf of Mexico may further divide or unify the population structure of this region.<br/><br/>In addition to the demographically discrete lineages identified for Horseshoe Crabs, a series of metapopulations and other individual collections delineated within each discrete lineage may be considered distinct management/recovery units for future management planning purposes. Metapopulations may exist in the Gulf of Maine (Maine and New Hampshire collections), the entire Mid-Atlantic region (with some substructure within), the upper Chesapeake Bay collections (MDT, MDF), the Southeast assemblage (SBB, SBE, GSA, and GSI), southwest Florida Gulf of México (FMI, FCH, FTB), and the northwest Florida Gulf of México (FCK, FAP). Within areas bounded by zones of genetic discontinuity, there appears to be substantial gene flow between each population and its nearest neighbours; the presence of these metapopulations appears to bode well for the demographic fitness of some regions.<br/><br/>Genetic diversity was sufficiently high at the nDNA markers that each individual surveyed (N = 1,841) possessed a unique multilocus genotype. This allowed assessment of sex-specific gene flow patterns which indicated a trend toward reduced philopatry (breeding site fidelity) in male Horseshoe Crabs throughout their range. This trend toward decreased female vagility and increased male vagility peaked in the region between the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. There is significantly more male migration between these two bays than female gene flow. These results agreed with those of Pierce <em>et al</em>. (2000) in regard to both structure of mtDNA variation and lack of structure detected by the nDNA RAPD markers. This sex-biased dispersal persists even with direct access between the bays via the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal constructed in the early half of the 19th century. These findings imply that should a population become extirpated, gene flow alone may not be sufficient to repopulate an area due to limited larval dispersal potential (Botton and Loveland 2003) and female migration (Swan 2005) between embayments.<br/><br/>Any further quantification of the degree of migration between Delaware and Chesapeake Bays is difficult due the absence of structure between sample collections from the two bays. Additional mitochondrial DNA data validated by tagging studies targeting females are required to allow quantification of the effective migration between Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Swan (2005) found that among the 14 Horseshoe Crabs that were observed to have travelled &gt;100 km from their tagging location, one was recovered in Chesapeake Bay, but not during spawning season.<br/><br/>In their entirety, these research findings suggest a series of discontinuities across the species’ range that could indicate regional adaptive significance or reflect vicariant geographic events. Regional groupings (Figure 3 in the supplementary material) may warrant management unit status based on the presence of statistically significant allele frequency heterogeneity, allocation of genetic diversity, and a high percentage of correct classification to region of origin. Moreover, a pattern of male-biased gene flow was observed among all collections from Maine to Florida’s eastern Gulf of Mexico coast that suggests management efforts might best be targeted at a finer scale. These findings also provide justification for release of Horseshoe Crabs sampled by scientific or commercial interests near the original collection site.<br/><br/>The presence of demographically distinct and evolutionarily significant lineages delineated by zones of genetic discontinuity is consistent with the findings of researchers assessing behavioural patterns. The integration of the information from the nuclear genome with previously identified allozyme (Selander <em>et al</em>. 1970) and mitochondrial DNA variation (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1986, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2000) and ecological data should prove essential to developing an ecologically and evolutionarily sound management strategy.<br/><br/>Based on the major zones of discontinuity in the genotypic patterns of nDNA, we structured the risk assessment into the following regions and then integrated the regional assessments to the species level. The transnational genetically-defined regions (also referred to a subpopulations) were (Figures 1 and 3 in the supplementary material):<br/><ul><li>Gulf of Maine (USA) including embayments from Great Bay estuary in New Hampshire and north into Maine.</li><li>Mid-Atlantic (USA) including all embayments south of New Hampshire to and including North Carolina.</li><li>Southeast (USA) including embayments in South Carolina and Georgia, but note that the Georgia population extends into northern Florida.</li><li>Florida Atlantic (USA) including embayments along the Atlantic coast of Florida south of the Georgia population.</li><li>Northeast Gulf of México (USA) including embayments along the Gulf coast of Florida, Alabama, barrier islands of Mississippi, and eastern most barrier island of Louisiana .</li><li>Yucatán Peninsula (México) including embayments on the western, northern, and eastern portions of the peninsula (the Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo) and Mexican portion of the Caribbean Sea.</li></ul><em><strong>Population Trends<br/></strong></em>Data availability determined whether quantitative analysis was valid for trend estimation. In the absence of a quantitative analysis, descriptive summaries of observations were included to infer qualitative trends in relative abundance and distribution.<br/><br/><em><u>Qualitative Trends in the Gulf of Maine</u></em><br/>The northernmost population of Horseshoe Crabs was studied for 10 years from 2001 to 2010 (Schaller 2011, Schaller and Dorsey 2011). The study included daily surveys in Taunton Bay, Maine during late May and June each year where 6,964 spawning Horseshoe Crabs were tagged and released (sex ratio of 1.8 males to females). Based on this study, the authors were “cautiously optimistic” that the population in Taunton Bay was stable (Schaller 2011). Pete Thayer (Maine Department of Marine Resources, pers. comm.) stated that “Over the late 90’s to late 2000’s, Horseshoe Crabs were fished down a bit for eel bait until a seasonal closure regulation was enacted, from which point they appeared to be bouncing back in the survey’s final years.” Moore and Perrin (2007) who tracked Horseshoe Crabs in Taunton Bay, a tributary of Frenchman Bay, during 2003-2005 observed no emigration; and thus considered the populations to be resident to the embayment.<br/><br/>In 2001 to 2004, spawning surveys were conducted at five sites in the Gulf of Maine to establish baseline data (Schaller <em>et al</em>. 2005). Schaller <em>et al</em>. (2005) remarked that Horseshoe Crab spawning density is sparse throughout Maine and that three historical breeding sites are no longer used by Horseshoe Crabs for spawning. Of the five sites where surveys were conducted in all years (2001 to 2004), counts of spawning Horseshoe Crabs increased in three surveys and decreased in two.<br/><br/><em><u>Quantitative Trends in Gulf of Maine (New Hampshire), Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Florida-Atlantic, and Northeast Gulf of México </u></em><br/>Data were available from 40 fishery-independent data sets covering Mid-Atlantic and Florida regions (New Hampshire to Florida; regions as defined above and in Figure 1) over a range of years. The fishery-independent data sets were selected by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) for stock assessment (ASMFC, Sweka <em>et al</em>. 2013). ASMFC selects datasets that are overseen or conducted by state or federal agencies or academic institutions using standardized methodology and survey design. State agencies rely on these datasets to comply with ASMFC monitoring requirements. The basic data were individual counts of Horseshoe Crabs within sampling units; the demographic (age-class, sex) and temporal and spatial resolution of each dataset is described in Sweka <em>et al</em>. (2013: Appendix B) and summarized in Table 2 (in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>We analysed trends from each dataset and then used meta-analysis techniques to summarize inference at the regional or sub-regional level because the data came from many independent monitoring programs. We grouped the datasets from the Mid-Atlantic region into sub-regions because of geographic differences in harvest pressure and environmental conditions. The sub-regions were New England states (NH, RI, MA), New York area (CT, NY), and Delaware Bay area (NJ, DE, MD, VA). In addition, datasets represented the Southeastern (NC, SC, GA), Florida Atlantic (FL), and Gulf of México (FL) regions. There were no state-specific datasets from NC; however, data from an offshore monitoring program (SEAMAP) included waters off the NC coast. The time series varied among the datasets. The New England area included the longest time series, with one data set from 1959 and several that started in the 1970s. Data sets from the New York and Delaware Bay areas started in the late 1980s. Data sets from the Southeast included several that started in the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>The objective of the meta-analysis of regional trends was to determine change in Horseshoe Crab populations during the periods defined by the available data. The trend analyses involved fitting a linear regression to the data, which had been standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Standardization was required for the trend analysis results based on individual datasets to be combined using meta-analysis techniques.<br/><br/>We used three meta-analysis techniques described by Manly (2001:123-125):<br/><ul><li>Fisher’s method addressed the hypothesis that at least one of the indices showed a significant decline (<em>S</em><sub>1</sub>). See the supplementary material for the test statistic calculation.</li><li>Stouffer’s method addressed the hypothesis that there was a consensus for a decline supported by the set of indices (<em>S</em><sub>2</sub>). A version of the Stouffer’s method incorporated weighting into the calculation of the test statistic (<em>S</em><sub>3</sub>). See the supplementary material for the calculations.</li><li>A weighted standardized slope along with confidence intervals addressed the hypothesis that the datasets showed a significant decline on average. See the supplementary material for the calculation.</li></ul>Results indicated that there have been significant declines in at least one dataset in all areas except the Southeast and Florida as evidenced by test <em>S</em><sub>1</sub> (Table 3 in the supplementary material). The breadth of decline was evidenced by <em>S</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>S</em><sub>3</sub>, and weighted slope, which all indicate that breadth of declines was highest in the New England area and diminished generally from the northern to southeastern areas with indications of negative slopes for Florida Atlantic and Northeast Gulf regions (Table 3 and Figure 4 in the supplementary material). The uncertainty in the Florida Atlantic estimates was high, in part, because of the low number of and variation in trends among available datasets (Figure 4 in the supplementary material). Although the sub-regional level inference for Florida Atlantic suggested no significant decline in the Horseshoe Crab population, the datasets from Jacksonville indicated an embayment-specific decline.<br/><br/>For those regions or sub-regions with negative weighted slope (i.e., Gulf of Maine (NH), New England area, New York area, Northeast Gulf region), population reduction over 40 years, which approximates three generations based on age-structured population models (Sweka <em>et al</em>. 2007), can be projected assuming the current linear trends continue and the index represents population abundance (see the Supplementary Material for the formula used for this projection.<br/><br/>Continuation of these negative trends would result in projected population reductions of 100% in Gulf of Maine (NH), 92% in New England, 11% in New York, 55% in Florida Atlantic, and 32% in Northeast Gulf of México. Although not accounting for carrying capacity limits to population growth, projections indicate population increases in the Delaware Bay of 116% and in the Southeast region of 218% over 40 years.<br/><br/><u><em>Qualitative Trends in the Yucatán Peninsula </em></u><br/>It has been claimed that population sizes in México dwindled dramatically between the 1960s and the early 1990s, especially in the Laguna de Términos area (Gómez-Aguirre 1979, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1993). However, these claims cannot be fully substantiated as they were not based on formal quantitative surveys. There have been no periodical quantitative assessments of population sizes in México, which would allow comparisons between at least two points in time for specific localities.<br/><br/><u><em>Population Viability Analyses</em></u><br/>There have been several efforts to develop population models useful for assessing the viability of populations subject to harvest and to explore population dynamics (Gibson and Olszewski 2001, Grady and Valiela 2006, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sweka <em>et al</em>. 2007, McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013). Modelling studies have focused on Horseshoe Crab populations in Rhode Island (Gibson and Olszewski 2001), Cape Cod (Grady and Valiela 2006), and Delaware Bay (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sweka <em>et al</em>. 2007, McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013). All analyses concluded that over harvest results in population depletion, but that some levels of reduced harvest can be compatible with a viable population. Gibson and Olszweski (2001) and Davis <em>et al</em>. (2006) used production models to examine biomass recovery of populations in Rhode Island and Delaware Bay that had been depleted by overfishing. Gibson and Olszweski (2001) estimated intrinsic growth rate of 0.5 (finite rate of 1.6) for population in Rhode Island and concluded that recovery would take 10 years under no harvest and 20 years under harvest well below recent levels. Davis <em>et al</em>. (2006) concluded that the Delaware Bay population had been overfished and projected that recovery could occur within four years, but likely would take longer than 15 years. Grady and Valiela (2006) and Sweka <em>et al</em>. (2007) used life-history structured models to examine population dynamics of populations in Cape Cod embayments and Delaware Bay, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that population growth was most sensitive to variation in early life stage and juvenile survival. The generation time according to the age-structured population model (Sweka <em>et al</em>. 2007) model is 13.7 years. The modelling by Grady and Valiela (2006) suggested seasonal closures along with low levels of harvest are required for sustainability. Sweka <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined the role of density-dependent egg mortality on population abundance under different harvest levels, and consistent with previous analyses, identified sustainable harvest levels that allowed for population growth. The Sweka model became the basis for predictive modelling to support adaptive management of Horseshoe Crab and Red Knots (<em>Calidris canutus rufa</em>) in Delaware Bay (see the Conservation Actions section, <em>Harvest Management</em>; McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,yes,Invertebrate,spp_th

In a study assessing the factors affecting mortality of<em> L. mormyrus</em> caught and released in a recreational fishery in the Balearic Islands, this species exhibited higher mortality rates (33%) compared to <em>Diplodus annularis</em>, with over 90% of the catch under the minimum legal size. Deep-hooking was the strongest predictor of mortality (Alos <em>et al.</em> 2009).","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>L. mormyrus </em>but in South Africa, it is included in the total daily bag limit for recreational and subsistence fishers of ten fish &#160;per person per day for unlisted species (Richardson and Lamberth 2013). <em>Lithognathus mormyrus</em> occurs in several marine protected areas within its range (World Database of Protected Areas, accessed 11 March 2014). It is recommended that more genetic research be done for the management of this species. Strategies, such as promoting the use of more selective gears that  reduce the capture of undersized fish (Fabi<em> et al.</em> 2002) and the use of circle hooks and implementing gentler release  techniques, should be considered in managing these species (Alos <em>et al.</em><span style=""""font-style: italic;""""> </span>2009).&#160;In South Africa, it probably receives some protection in the Tsitsikamma National Park and the De Hoop Marine Reserve, as well as in other MPAs along the Southeastern and Southwestern Cape coast where fishing is prohibited (Mann and van der Elst 2000). In South Africa,&#160;<em>L. mormyrus </em>is not an important target species due to its small size; however, size and bag limits should be implemented and direct management in the subsistence shore fishery is probably most needed (Richardson and Lamberth 2013).",Stable,"<em>Lithognathus mormyrus</em> is common in the eastern and southern Mediterranean Sea, but less common in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. It is also common in eastern Atlantic and the two populations of this species present a sharp Atlantic-Mediterranean genetic separation (Bargelloni <em>et al</em>. 2003). Recent research in Israel indicates that current individuals are smaller than those known from historical museum specimens, and most specimens currently caught are one year old and mature (M. Goren pers. comm.). This same trend is observed in Turkey (K. Bizsel and B. Yokes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In a study by Akyol and Ertosluk (2010), captures from the sea-cage farms along the coast of the Turkish Aegean Sea were determined with the use of a special cage trap and trammel net. Hand or longlines and underwater harpoons, although rare, were also in use. This species was dominant and accounted for 0.7% of the total weight of one fish farm from 2004–2008. &#160;<br/><br/>FAO catch statistics from 1996 to 2006 for the Mediterranean ranged from 718 tonnes to 1,135 tonnes and were fairly stable over this period, with five countries reporting catch data.

Conservation measures that effectively reduced catch by one-third were implemented in 2007 in order to recover South Atlantic populations that were overfished since the 1980s. In the Gulf of Mexico, tilefishes were added to the Fishery Management Plan for the reef fish fishery with the passing of Amendment 1 in 1990, under the authority of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Management is not species-specific.&#160;The tilefish fishery off the&#160;eastern&#160;United States (which covers multiple species) was originally an open-access fishery, however, a Fishery Management Plan was put in place on 1 November 2001 which applies to Virginia/North Carolina.&#160;Tilefish south of North Carolina are managed under the Southern Atlantic Fishery Management Council's FMP for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery. The key measures taken by the Fishery Management Plan included a 10-year stock rebuilding schedule; a commercial quota divided into full-time, part-time and incidental categories; a trip limit for the incidental category; and limited entry for the full-time and part-time categories. The tilefish FMP became experimental as it did not expect cooperation nor was there a consequence for lack of cooperation.&#160;The FMP originally qualified 51 vessels for tilefish fishing, however, this number has gradually declined to 30 vessels. An annual Total Allowable Landings quota was established as well as a limited access program which established three permit categories (Rountree&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span>&#160;2008). An individual fishing quota (IFQ) program was implemented for the grouper and tilefish fisheries in 2010 (Scott-Denton&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.&#160;</span>2011).&#160;<br/><br/>The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council designated eight marine protected areas between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA and the Florida Keys to protect seven species of the deepwater snapper-grouper complex in February 2009. These consist of five species of grouper and two tilefishes, including&#160;<em>Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. microps</em>.&#160;Managers have closed four deep water canyons in the Mid-Atlantic to bottom-tending mobile gear (including otter trawls) in order to protect tilefish habitat.<br/><br/>Tilefishes are considered data-poor for stock assessment purposes, and therefore, have many research needs. Research priorities for the Gulf of Mexico stock include: improving abundance indices, stock definition and structure, and life history components (SEDAR 2011).",Decreasing,"<strong><em>Canada/U.S. Atlantic</em></strong><br/>The U.S. and Canadian tilefish fishery began in 1879 and collapsed shortly thereafter with a mass mortality event caused by cold water intrusion in 1882 (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2014). It began to recover in the late 1890s with an abundance of young fish (Bumpus 1899), and by 1915 the species was again being fished. The reported fishery landings have been highly variable, with peaks in 1914-1915, the late 1920s, mid-1950s, and mid-1970s (Freeman and Turner 1977) and low but relatively stable since 1984 (Shepherd 1998). Shepherd (1998) notes low landings and a significant decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the north stock since about 1981 as evidence of over-exploitation. Turner (1986) reported that the effects of fishing have been drastic and stock size has been reduced by half to two-thirds, a level that continued into the mid-1990s (Shepherd 1998). High fishing mortality has truncated the size structure of the population; fewer larger fish greater than 70 cm have been landed (Grimes <em>et al</em>. 1980, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1983). The resurgence of this offshore fishery in the early 1970s partly as a recreational fishery may be a response to the decline of inshore fisheries because of habitat degradation and overfishing (McHugh 1977). However, a recent study found that changes in water temperature off New England due to anomalous cold water intrusions in the 1970s likely decreased survivability and overall reproductive success. This environmental stress combined with increased exploitation contributed to the significant population declines during this period (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2014). Barans and Stender (1993) reported similar declines in stock size and mean individual size as the South Atlantic Bight fishery developed, and harvests have also declined since the late 1980s (Parker and Mays 1998).<br/><br/>Hightower and Grossman (1989) determined fishing mortality of the southeast U.S. population to range from 0.10 (M - 0.10) to 0.48 (M = 0.25) which results in sustainable yields of 40 (M - 0.10) to 82 t (M = 0.25) per year. They obtained higher estimates of virgin population density (883-1,710 per km²) when research CPUE data were used and determined sustained yield estimates also were higher, ranging from 55 (M - 0.10) to 148 t (M = 0.25) per year. Observed yields in the developing fishery exceeded 100 t in 1981-1984 and in 1986; however, current observations indicate that fishing effort has declined to a low level in response to reduced catches. They recommend that the annual harvest not exceed about 50 t, which should result in a stock biomass of about 400 t to 800 t.<br/><br/>According to the Mid-Atlantic (<a href=""""http://nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd1404/partb.pdf"""">SARC58 2014</a>) stock assessment, predicted total spawning stock biomass declined by 76% over the past 42 years (1971-2012; Table B26 page 416). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series. According to the South Atlantic (<a href=""""http://sedarweb.org/docs/sar/SEDAR25_TilefishSAR.pdf"""">SEDAR25 2011</a>) stock assessment, predicted spawning stock biomass declined by 50% over the past 47 years (1962-2010; Table 5.3 page 24). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series. Point estimates from the base model indicate that the U.S. southeast stock of <em>Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps</em> is currently not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, the estimated time series of F/FMSY calculated by SEDAR suggests that the populations had been overfished during the assessment period (SEDAR25 2011). Hightower and Grossman (1988) determined adult population density prior to fishing ranged from 603 to 950 per km² and stock biomass ranged from 1,130 to 1,570 tonnes (t). They obtained higher estimates of virgin population density (883-1,710 per km²) when research CPUE data were used. Although total landings vary greatly, CPUE data showed continuous decline prior to 1999 in the mid-Atlantic. Although total landings vary greatly, CPUE data show continuous decline. Steimle <em>et al</em>. (1999) report declines in CPUE (Georges Bank - Middle Atlantic) from 1970 to 1995 from over 6 mt/day to 1 mt/day, which represents an approximate decline of 78% over 24 years and represents an average decline in CPUE of 3.25% per year. Future declines in CPUE are probable.&#160; <br/><br/><em><strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong></em><br/>Total biomass and spawning biomass in the eastern Gulf of Mexico declined steadily beginning in the early 1980s; in the western Gulf of Mexico it declined until 1990, then increased from 1996 to 2000 and remain relatively constant from 2000 onward (<a href=""""http://sedarweb.org/docs/sar/tilefish_SAR_FINAL.pdf"""">SEDAR22 2011</a>). Mean age of females in 1965 was 6 years, declined to 2 years in 1997, and increased to a mean age of 4 years in 2009. According to the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR22 2011) stock assessment, predicted spawning stock biomass declined by 41% and total biomass by 68% over the past 45 years (1965-2009; Table 3 page 32). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series generated using the SS3 central realization/SS run 1. The SS3 Central/SS run 1 realization stood out to the SEDAR22 working group as the most pragmatic choice to visualized trends abundance, biomass and exploitation of this species. The following information reflects this choice, however the working group recognized that this is only one of many equally plausible runs (SEDAR22 2011). It was concluded that overfishing of the Gulf of Mexico tilefish stock was not occurring and the stock was not overfished in 2009 (SEDAR22 2011).<br/>Wide geographic separation and evidence of limited movements may necessitate management as separate south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stocks. For this reason, it is assumed that there is little emigration or immigration of this species in or out of the Gulf. The majority of its population in the Gulf of Mexico may be present in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as this species is mostly associated with compacted mud habitat. Given its habitat preference, we estimate that at least 70% of its Gulf of Mexico population occurs in the northern Gulf in U.S. waters. In Mexico, all tilefishes are recorded in mixed catches of either Blanquillo camelo or Conejo Amarillo and there are no species-specific statistics collected. It may be known as Corvinato. There are no specific management measures for tilefishes in Mexico. They are not very common in markets, and may be seasonal catches. This species also occurs as by-catch in the Mexican Red Grouper fishery.<br/><br/><em><strong>Global</strong></em><br/>Biomass estimates show an increasing trend over at least the past decade for the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic stocks, however, it has been declining since 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico. Population declines estimated from the spawning stock biomass in the three assessment areas (Mid-Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic) were weighted based on the proportion of recruits occurring in each area in 1971 (the earliest year of available data for the Mid Atlantic). The proportion of recruits was estimated to be 64% in the Mid-Atlantic, 26% in the South Atlantic, and 10% in the Gulf of Mexico. Percent declines were estimated using the endpoints of the available data and resulted in different starting and ending years for each area (Mid-Atlantic: 41 years; Gulf of Mexico: 44 years; South Atlantic: 48 years). Based on the shape of the time series of spawning stock biomass, we suspect that these endpoints are a reasonable representation of the state of the population now and three generation lengths ago. Therefore, the weighted overall spawning stock biomass decline of 66% was assumed to have occurred over the past three generations (48 years).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Spawning aggregations are targeted by fishers throughout its range. This species is prized by recreational anglers along Florida's east coast where the majority of landings occur from Cape Canaveral, Florida, through the Florida Keys. The species is popular with spearfishermen in many areas. This species is also subject of a commercial fishery mainly harvested with hook-and-line or spearfishing gear (Burton 2002). Mutton Snapper form spawning aggregations with a high degree of site fidelity (Domeier and Colin 1997) and as such are vulnerable to capture and overexploitation. Juveniles of this species are taken by shrimp trawl bycatch and the shallow vegetation used for settlement and juvenile grow-out can be impacted by coastal construction activities.","This species was ranked as Vulnerable in a 1996 IUCN Red List (Huntsman 1996). Additional information has become available since and the IUCN criteria for Red List rankings have evolved with a greater emphasis on data that can specifically demonstrate population or biomass declines over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council established that both commercial and recreational fisheries for Mutton Snapper require a limited access permit, a 16"""" TL size limit, and a restriction of 10 fish per person per day or per trip (whichever is more restrictive) during the months of May and June. In addition, some gear restrictions apply and there are annual catch limits on both sectors. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf FMC) also establishes regulations for the recreational Mutton Snapper fishery of 16"""" TL size limit; fishing is permitted year-round, but a maximum of 10 fish are permitted per person per day within the snapper aggregate.&#160;In 1992, the Gulf of Mexico Management Council imposed a two month spawning season closure (May and June). Such an intensive fishery likely removes an excessive number of fish that would likely be reproductively active for longer than was previously thought (up to 29 years; Burton 2002). The establishment of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve was in part focused on protecting the Mutton Snapper spawning aggregation at Rileys Hump in the Lower Florida Keys using fisher outreach (Lindeman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Cowie-Haskell and Delaney 2003) and enforcement support including an advanced, high speed vessel (M/V Peter Gladding). Field research subsequent to the closure of Riley’s Hump suggests some population recovery may be occurring (Burton<em> et al.</em>&#160;2005, A. Acosta pers. comm. 2014). In Cuba, the use of set nets has been banned since 2008 and long bottom trawls since 2012 over the entire shelf. In commercial and recreational fisheries, the minimum catch size is 25 cm FL, which allows a substantial catch of juveniles (Claro <em>et al.</em> 2009). Heyman and Kjerfve (2008) documented a consistent Mutton Snapper aggregation at an important multi-species aggregation area in Gladden Spit, Belize. There was a sharp reduction in landings and fishing effort in the late 1980s at this site during rapid growth in the tourism industry and during a shift in fisher livelihoods (Grandados-Dieseldorff <em>et al</em>. 2013). Annual CPUE, individual sizes and sex ratios have been relatively stable from 1999-2011, indicating persistence of the fishery and an absence of overfishing, at least at this site, which corresponds with consistent engagement with the fisher community. In Puerto Rico, there is a mandatory commercial license and permit requirement, and a temporal closure during the spawning season in state waters April-May and US federal waters from April-June. In the US Virgin Islands, there is a closed season from April-June in US federal waters (Russell <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Decreasing,"The species is prized in warmer Florida state waters and recreational fishing accounted for more fishing mortality in Florida than commercial or headboat fisheries (O’Hop <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Commercial landings in the US South Atlantic range from a minimum of 7.6 mt in 2007 to a peak of 131.4 mt in 1973, and reflect a 76% decline over a three generation length estimate of 24 years, from 68.7 mt in 1990 to 16.3 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). For the southeast coast of Florida, coincident with a 50% decline in effort, combined landings of 11 reef fish species from the headboat fishery in southeast Florida declined by 85% between 1990-2006 (Ault and Franklin 2011). While landings of <em>L. analis </em>declined by 92%, from about 25 mt in 1990 to 2 mt in 2006, it is unclear if the decline in landings is due solely to the decline in effort (Ault and Franklin 2011). Biomass declined to a low in 1994 and then increased to 9570 mt in 2006 (Table 5, Figure 3, SEDAR 2008). Estimated recreational landings from the Atlantic coast of the US peaked in 2008 at 772,798 individuals with 2014 landings at 280,281 individuals (NMFS 2015b). In 2013, the SEDAR Update Assessment of <em>L. analis</em> in both the US South Atlantic and GOM concluded that maximum fishing mortality threshold was 0.18 per year (defined as fishing mortality rate associated with a spawning potential ratio of 30%) and using prior SAFMC and GMFMC protocols, Mutton Snapper was not considered overfished or to be undergoing overfishing (O’Hop <em>et al</em>. 2015). Older assessments from the 1990s indicated that the spawning stock ratio was above the criterion for overfishing established by the SAFMC (Huntsman <em>et al</em>. 1992, 54% in Ault<em> et al</em>. 1998). For US federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, commercial landings of <em>L. analis</em> increased steadily from 1950 through the mid-1980s, to a peak of 164.5 mt in 1987, with a decline to 66.3 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a), representing a decline of 60% over 27 years. Estimated recreational landings from the GOM peaked in 1984 with 319,964 individuals, in 2014 256,391 individuals were reported (NMFS 2015b).This species is caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It is sold in the domestic markets of mainly Mexico City and Guadalajara (SAGARPA 2012). Juveniles are extensively caught in the shrimp fishery, but no official statistics are available at this time. Landings of mixed snapper species in Mexico have fluctuated but appear relatively stable from 1970s to 1996, with little data after these years (INP 2000).<br/><br/><em>Lutjanus analis </em>is historically one of the most targeted species by commercial and recreational fisheries off Cuba. Catch was relatively stable until the early 1990s when a major decline began due to reduced commercial effort, intense subsistence fishing, and historical overexploitation of spawning aggregations (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Total landings decreased from 1,326 mt in 1987 to 645 mt in 2010, a 51% decline over 24 years. Traditionally, about 50% of the landings were from Archipelago Sabana-Camaguey, north-central Cuba. Ranging from small to major declines, evidence suggests that spawning aggregations have decreased in size (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Landings in northeastern Cuba were relatively stable from 1970s to 1995, but by 2010 catches declined over 50% from more than 400 mt to 145 mt, with stable or increasing effort. Recreational and subsistence fishing also increased during this period.&#160;The Puerto Rican and the US Virgin Islands population managed by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council considers Mutton Snapper current stock exploitation status as not undergoing overfishing, and stock biomass status was not overfished. The majority of landings are from the trap and/or pots, and hook and line fishery. Through the 23 year time series from 1983 to 2005, commercial catches declined 50% (SEDAR 2007, Table 2). Removals from hook and line gear accounted for some 46% of the removals across all years, while pots or traps accounted for about 28.5% (SEDAR 2007). In Colombia, this species can be second only to <em>L. synagris</em> in importance to the lutjanid fishery (Acero and Garzon 1985). The species is fished with many gears in Venezuela (Cervigon 2003).<br/><br/>In east Brazil, a stock assessment conducted by Klippel <em>et al</em>. (2005) estimated that the stock was moderately overexploited. For the northeastern coast, the stock is considered to be overexploited at 20% above the recommended level (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009). In northeast Brazil, <em>L. analis</em> is one of the most common snappers, both in abundance and catch, and has been deemed as being overexploited with low resiliency (Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species was considered exploited by artisanal hand-line fleets in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil (Gomes de Mattos and Maynou 2009). In the Abrolhos Reef system, the species was reported but ranked below &lt;0.1 in percentage of total biomass (Francini-Filho 2008). In Rio de Janeiro, <em>L. analis </em>are harvested as juveniles, detrimental to stock structure for slow-growing species (Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

This species is found at considerably greater abundances in areas which are not fished (Polunin and Roberts 1993). Trawling of seagrass beds within the range can impact recruitment (A. Acero pers. comm. 2009). In the Colombian Caribbean, this species’ abundance has been affected by indiscriminate fishing, mainly by the use of dynamite around the reefs of Rosario islands, where it has almost been exterminated (Acero and Garzón 1985). Adults of this species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Size and bag limits have been established for <em>L. apodus </em>in federal waters of the southeast US, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands. In the United States, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council has size restrictions in place for this species: both recreational and commercial landings from areas three to 200 miles off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and east Florida, harvested individuals must be at least 12 inches in length (TL). This species is included in the 10 fish limit per person for snappers. In Cuba, the minimum legal size is 6 ounces, equivalent to 170 g and approximately 19 cm FL. In both observational and manipulative studies, <em>L. apodus </em>demonstrated inverse density dependent survival; individuals in large shoals were likely less vulnerable to predation than those in small shoals. This suggests that small no-take reserves, which should reduce fishing mortality, might also decrease natural mortality by reducing predation (Wormald <em>et al.</em> 2013). Monitoring of population numbers is needed to estimate trends in abundance over time and the severity of certain threats.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is common throughout its range in high visibility shallow and mid-shelf areas with vegetation and reef structure.

In US waters, the commercial sector has reported ranges of 0.0 to 0.1 mt of <em>L. apodus </em>since 1991 (NMFS 2015a); the recreational sector has reported zero to more than 220,000 individuals landed each year since 1981, but the estimates are imprecise (NMFS 2015b). Spawning potential ratios were estimated at 11% for the Florida Keys by Ault <em>et al. </em>(1998). None of the US Fishery Management Councils consider this species to be undergoing overfishing or to be overfished. In Mexico, there are no official statistics on captures or on the status of the stock. In Cuba, this species occurs in fishery landings, but is not abundant and landings are relatively stable (Claro and Lindeman 2008, R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). It was the second most abundant species after <em>O. chrysurus</em> in trap sampling conducted around the Jamaican shelf (Thompson and Munro 1983).

It is also highly valued in Mexican waters, but we could not identify formal management planning or stock assessment documents, though overfishing is assumed to be occurring. Bycatch of juvenile Red Snapper in Gulf shrimp trawl fisheries may have contributed to population declines of the stock. Shrimp fishery bycatch in U.S. waters has declined (SEDAR 31 2013); however, substantial fishery bycatch remains in Mexican waters (SAGARPA 2012) and bycatch reductions devices are not universally implemented.<br/><br/>There is some concern that the explosive decommissioning of oil platforms poses a significant risk of mortality to surrounding fishes. It&#160;is prone to high release mortality, because it inhabits relatively deep water and possesses a physoclistus gas bladder (Campbell&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The recent implementation of an Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) system for <em>L. campechanus</em> may be causing increased release rates in the Gulf of Mexico (Cullis-Suzuki<em> et al.</em> 2012).","<strong><em>U.S. Gulf of Mexico<br/></em></strong>The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council implemented a Reef fish Fishery Management Plan in 1984 to rebuild declining reef fish stocks, including red snapper. Gulf Red Snapper is under a rebuilding program that aims to restore the stock by 2032. Recent population assessments indicate an increase under recent fishery regulations.<br/><br/>The recreational fishery for red snapper in the Gulf is open during a limited period of time per year, and catches are monitored so as not to exceed a yearly quota.&#160;Recreational anglers are permitted to keep only two red snapper per person, per day, that measure a minimum of 16 total length. In addition, anglers must have in possession a venting tool and dehooking device when fishing for Gulf reef fish. The use of non-stainless steel circle hooks is also required for fishermen using natural baits. Commercial fishing regulations include a 13-inch minimum  size limit, an annual quota of 2.55 million pounds, gear restrictions,  closed areas, and an IFQ program. The IFQ  program allocates individual shares of the commercial quota to  fishermen. Fishermen may harvest their quotas whenever they choose to do  so and must report their harvest.&#160;The 2012 Regulatory Amendment to Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper eliminated the October-December closed recreational fishing season, increased the commercial and recreational quotas, and maintained the individual fishing quota program for the commercial sector (SEDAR 31 2013). Although a variety of minimum size regulations have been implemented to help rebuild the population, this may not be an efficient method because of the high discard mortality (Deleveaux 2012).<br/><br/>In the mid-1990s, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were used to limit the bycatch of juveniles in the shrimp trawl fishery (SEDAR 31 2013). While the BRDs did not appear to reduce juvenile bycatch to the expected degree, shrimp fishing effort has been reduced substantially since 2002, which may be improving survival probabilities for juveniles in some areas (Cowan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Porch 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Red Snapper caught in the Madison Swanson Marine Reserve (northeastern Gulf of Mexico) are significantly larger and older than those caught outside the reserve and there appears to be a spill-over effect to nearby locations (Koenig and Coleman 2013).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>U.S. Atlantic</em><br/></strong>To address overfishing of Red Snapper in the southeast U.S., the Council developed Amendment 17A to the Snapper-Grouper Management Plan. The final rule implemented the following in 2010: prohibit all harvest and possession of red snapper in federal waters of the South Atlantic and in state waters for vessels holding federal snapper-grouper permits; require the use of circle hooks in the snapper-grouper fishery in federal waters north of 28 latitude; and require a program to monitor red snapper. As a result of these measures, the population has begun to increase since 2010. The Red Snapper is currently managed under a rebuilding plan whereby the South Atlantic Council established a process for a short season opening each year as long as total mortality (removals and discard mortality) is below the Acceptable Biological Catch (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015). Red Snapper inhabit multiple MPAs under several designations established by the SAFMC in the southeast Atlantic coast. &#160;<br/><strong><br/><em>Mexico</em><br/></strong>Off Mexico, access to the commercial snapper fishery is controlled through permits and gear type is restricted to increase intraspecific selectivity. Management recommendations call for&#160;reductions of at least 30% in fishing mortality off the states of Yucatan, Campeche and Veracruz and to reduce the sale of fishing licenses&#160;off Tampico, Quintana Roo and Tabasco (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;It is also recommended to introduce the use of appropriate bycatch reduction devices in shrimp trawls, issue permits specific to the resource, evaluate the effectiveness of these measures, and establish benchmarks for management plans (SAGARPA 2012). A stock assessment document on the Mexican population would be extremely valuable for comparison to the SEDAR documents and other research from the northern Gulf of Mexico and US Atlantic coast.",Decreasing,"<strong><em>U.S. Atlantic stock</em><br/></strong>The U.S. Atlantic stock component has been estimated to have about one-third the biomass of the Gulf of Mexico stock component (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015). From 1955-2010, t<u>he total stock biomass declined by 96% in the U.S. (SEDAR 24 2010). </u>This period does not exactly span three generation lengths; however, population declines likely exceed 96% for this whole period. Commercial Red Snapper landings increased from 1950 to the late 1960s (North Carolina to eastern Florida), peaking at 473 mt in 1968 (Manooch <em>et al. </em>1998, National Marine Fisheries Service pers. comm.). Between 1975-1998, annual landings declined from 327 mt to 40 mt. Eastern Florida landings dominated the catches through the mid 1970s, after which a precipitous decline occurred. Between 1990-2001, 58% of the total Red Snapper landings came from on Florida's Atlantic coast; with 6% in Georgia, 25% in South Carolina, and 11% in North Carolina. Recreational landings of red snapper peaked in 1985 at 605 mt. In 2014,&#160;recreational fishermen&#160;landed 477 mt, in spite of an extremely limited season. Manooch <em>et al</em>. (1998) suggested that the fishing mortality rate (F) should be reduced by 33% to 68%, depending on the natural mortality rate and desired SPR. These results were revisited by Potts and Brennan (2001) who suggested a broader range of reduction in F, from 30% to 80%. Prior to 2006, red snapper was listed as overfished in the South Atlantic (SEDAR 24 2010). As such, Amendment 4 to the South Atlantic Council’s Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan&#160;(regulations effective January 1992) implemented a rebuilding plan of 15 years beginning in 1991. Its status was changed to unknown because the previous pre-SFA determination of overfished was based on SPR (spawning potential ratio), which is inadequate because it is not biomass-based. Based on the results from SEDAR 15 (2008), it was reported as overfished and a new rebuilding plan was developed in Amendment 17A to the Snapper Grouper FMP. The 2010 stock assessment (SEDAR 24 2010) indicated that the U.S. southeast stock of red snapper is currently overfished and is experiencing overfishing. The estimated time series of F/FMSY suggests that overfishing has been occurring at least since the mid-1990's. The increase in stock status appears to have been assisted by the 1992 management regulations, and then perhaps reinforced by strong recruitment events. Base-run estimates of spawning biomass have remained below MSST throughout most of the time series. Current stock status was estimated in the base run to be SSB2009/MSST = 0.09. The estimated time series of F /FMSY suggests that overfishing has been occurring throughout most of the assessment period; F2007-2009/FMSY = 4.12. No new evidence is available that suggests the Atlantic and Gulf should be managed as a single stock, and no new evidence of regional separation within the Atlantic is available. An updated stock assessment for the south Atlantic region (anticipated SEDAR 41) is scheduled to be completed in November and peer-reviewed in&#160;2016. Preliminary analyses of fishery independent survey data indicate a large increase in CPUE from 2010 onwards, due in part to the fishery closure initiated in 2010 for the southeast U.S.; the stock is showing strong evidence for rebuilding over recent years (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>U.S. Gulf of Mexico stock</em><br/></strong>The U.S. Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery, which is targeted by commercial, for-hire, and recreational fishermen, is currently classified as overfished. The stock itself is divided into eastern and western Gulf components based on area-specific life history characteristics, catch statistics, and survey indices. The recovery of the population in the US Gulf is largely dependent upon the northwestern Gulf stock, which has long been considered to be the historical center of red snapper abundance&#160;<u>(SEDAR 31 2013)</u>.&#160;<u>In the eastern and western Gulf, estimates of spawning stock biomass have declined about 80-90% since the 1940s (although the majority of the population is in the western Gulf). Spawning stock biomass has been relatively stable at very low levels since the mid-1980's. According to the most recent stock assessment (SEDAR 31 2013), predicted total biomass declines ranged between 33-68% over the years 1945-2011.&#160;</u>Total biomass and spawning biomass steadily declined from the late 1880s through the early 1900s, and was stable up to the 1940s (SEDAR 31 2013). The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council implemented a Reef fish Fishery Management Plan in 1984 to rebuild declining reef fish stocks, including Red Snapper. Evidence of a decline in the adult population was documented as early as the late 1980s, during which the fishery was primarily supported by age<sup>-1</sup> to age<sup>-3</sup> fish. When the first Red Snapper stock assessment was conducted (Goodyear 1988), the stock was determined to be so overfished that reductions in fishing mortality of 60-70% would be required to rebuild the stock. The effective number of spawners in the eastern and western populations are estimated to have been reduced in 2003 to 39% and 50%, respectively. The effective spawner levels associated with the SMSY{current-shrimp} benchmark equates to 12.9% and 5.2% of unfished levels in the east and west, respectively (SEDAR 7 2005).&#160;Recreational landings from the US Gulf of Mexico have declined by 77% over 31 years; from 2.61 million individuals in 1981 to 0.59 million in 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014). The number of estimated individuals released alive annually has increased from 55,153 in 1981 to 1.42 million individuals in 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014); but many individuals suffer mortality from barotrauma.<br/><br/>The predicted mean age was 3.5 years in the year 1872 and since fishing began, declined to between 0.5-0.9 in 2004 (SEDAR 31 2013). The annual index of abundance in the northern Gulf from Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) ranged from near 0 to about 4.5 between 1982 and 2011, with no clear increasing or decreasing trends through the time series. There was a peak between 1989-1992, followed by a 14 year period of low abundances; since 2006, the index of abundance has fluctuated almost yearly (Pollack&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, see Figure 14 for data). This could be indicative of a substantial decline in the population prior to the initiation of the SEAMAP sampling program. A bioeconomic model intended to evaluate the different recreational management strategies found that the red snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico was not overfished or experiencing overfishing. This model incorporated density dependence and utilized a higher juvenile natural mortality rate, which likely caused the divergence between this model and previous stock assessment models. Although the authors did not suggest that this model replace the stock assessment, the results suggest that the red snapper fishery is underfished and the current management strategies are inefficient (Griffin and Woodward 2011).<br/><br/>In 2008, the Gulf of Mexico stock was evaluated as overfished and undergoing overfishing and in 2013, it was declared rebuilt (SEDAR 31 2013). Although populations in the U.S. no longer appear to be declining, annual catch limits in U.S. Gulf waters have been raised to 4,990 mt in response to strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 that occur on average every 5–7 years. Management has responded to increases in biomass by raising red snapper catch limits, only to have to reduce catches two to three years later to comply with the rebuilding schedule for this species. For example, after the strong 1989 year-class, catches were increased to 9.1 mt, only to be reduced because it became apparent the sustained catches were too high to meet management objectives. Similar histories occurred after strong year classes in 1995, and 1999-2000 and now in 2013 in response to the 2004 and 2006 year-classes. It is likely that landings of 11 mp going forward are unsustainable. There was some evidence that productivity of the stock was increasing in the early 2000s, but this trend appears to have ceased in recent years. In addition, the most recent benchmark stock assessment assumes that the S-R relationship has a very high estimate of steepness (0.99), inferring that recruitment may be almost independent of stock size. The SSR_Steepness factor is 0.94 for this species, which indicates the potential for a rapid recovery under the right conditions and that recruitment may be independent from stock size. Projections indicate that red snapper stock can rebuild within 31 years which is the longest recommended period by the NOAA Fisheries NSGs.&#160;The most recent stock assessment for the Gulf of Mexico is SEDAR 31 (2013). Though management has been more stringent for the Atlantic population than the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, biomass appears to be increasing at the same rate for both populations in recent years. Up to 20% of its historical biomass has been recovered within the past 20 years (equal to most recent generation length).&#160;<br/><br/>Furthermore, Red Snapper in the U.S. Gulf have a selectivity function that is dome shaped. Large, old, adult red snapper (highly fecund) have less affinity for structured habitat and move off higher relief natural and artificial reefs after they are about 10 years old. Most of these fish move onto either very low relief shell-rubble reefs or muddy/sandy bottoms with no relief, where they form small groups. Prior to 1990, there was a longline fishery for these large red snapper. Since 1990, longlines have been prohibited inside of 91 m, making these fish less vulnerable to exploitation. This has important consequences concerning stock status now because the time period (1980s to early 1990s) when the Gulf red snapper stock was at its lowest biomass (~20 years ago) was the time when most of today's most fecund spawners should have been produced, but were not, leaving a very truncated age distribution. There has been some rebuilding in the number of larger spawners, but high catches since the early 1990s appear to be limiting escapement to older age classes. As such, this species may rapidly recover much more under the right management (i.e., constant F) and governance conditions (J. Cowan pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The overfished status of the Red Snapper fishery is the result of not only an excessive amount of effort in the directed fishery, but also, a high level of bycatch mortality of juveniles by shrimp trawling. Without some reduction in bycatch, stock assessments projected that the stock cannot rebuild to BMSY even if no harvest was allowed in the directed fishery (SEDAR 31 2013). Therefore, large reductions in bycatch mortality from the shrimp fishery need to be achieved either through technological means such as bycatch reduction devices, or through a reduction in effort by the shrimp fishery. Currently, BRDs are estimated to achieve about a 40 percent reduction in red snapper bycatch and are required by law. The Gulf shrimp fishery was one of the most economically important fisheries in the United States, but effort has significantly declined since 2002 and it is now not considered to be a major threat to the stock's ability to rebuild (SEDAR 31 2013).&#160;<br/><br/><strong><em>Mexico<br/></em></strong>This is one of the most important Mexican fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico, with a historical centre of abundance on the Campeche Bank (Gonzalez-De La Rosa and Re-Regis 2001). Snappers are targeted by commercial and artisanal longline and hand line fisheries.&#160;<em>Lutjanus campechanus</em>&#160;is considered part of a multi-species fishery off Mexico, but represents 90% of the overall catch. The majority (74-87%) of red snapper landings are sold to international markets, while smaller species are sold domestically. Between the 1950s to 1970s (prior to the establishment of EEZ boundaries), U.S. and Cuban fishing fleets also exploited red snapper on the Campeche Bank (J. Ault pers. comm. 2015). In 2012, at least 16 Cuban vessels held permits to fish for snapper in Mexican waters (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Based on declining catch trends off Yucatan, Campeche and Veracruz, the fishery has deteriorated significantly.&#160;<u>Landings in Mexico have declined by 58% over the past 20 years, from 7,205 t in 1993 to 3,021 t in 2013 (SAGARPA annual landings reports 1980-2013). Effort is assumed to have been constant and possibly increased in some areas. In addition, biomass on the Campeche Bank declined by 49% between 1984-1999 (Instituto Nacional de la Pesca&#160;2000 via C. Monroy and T. Brule pers. comm. 2015)&#160;</u><u>and has not recovered</u><u>.&#160;</u>The estimated initial biomass (1984) was 33,740 t and in 1999 it was 17,150 t. There was an 80% decline in landings off Yucatan on the Campeche Bank between 1990-2013; the largest proportion (on average 27%) of the total landings are attributed to Yucatan State through the time series. There was also a 77% decline off Veracruz between 1991-2013 and a 71% decline off Campeche between 1993-2013. Landings off Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo appear to have remained stable. Effort has been increasing off Tabasco since at least 1990 and has been the leading producer of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico since 2002, but has not and likely will not reach the level of catch that Yucatan State had prior to the early 1990s. The last evaluation of the Mexican stock was conducted 15 years ago (Instituto Nacional de la Pesca&#160;2000) and this report concluded&#160;that the Campeche Bank stock was exploited slightly above its maximum sustainable yield and that a continuance of fishing at these levels would cause a decline in biomass.&#160;<br/><br/>As catch of <em>L. campechanus </em>has been declining, exploitation of other snappers such as <em>L. synagris</em> and <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been increasing (SAGARPA 2012). In addition, Mexican fishers from the state of Tamaulipas poached at least 692 mt of red snapper from U.S. waters off Texas in 2013-2014. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that they detected about 15% of these vessels that are fishing within the U.S. EEZ, which may indicate that they are taking more than is currently known (U.S. Coast Guard pers. comm. via GMFMC meeting presentation 2015). Juveniles frequently occur in large amounts as bycatch in the Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries; bycatch reduction devices are not consistently utilized in this region, but are encouraged (SAGARPA 2012).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/><em>Population connectivity<br/></em></strong>The pelagic larval duration for<em> Lujanus campechanus </em>is approximately 31 days (Rooker <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on a coupled bio-physical model of the Gulf of Mexico, larvae released on Campeche Bank are primarily retained on the bank. However, a small fraction of the released larvae were able to cross the deep basin to the southern portion of Florida (0.33%) or went through the Straits of Florida (1.6%) within 18-21 days (Johnston <em>et al</em>. 2013). Given the trajectory of the Loop Current, spawning aggregations in the northern Caribbean Sea might contribute larvae to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Otolith chemical signatures suggest that there is little mixing between the populations in US and Mexican waters and that the larger red snapper population in the northwestern Gulf may be serving as a source region of recruits for the north central region (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is likely that the populations east and west of the Mississippi are metapopulations.

Both <em>L. synagris</em> and <em>L. griseus </em>were estimated to have had a high risk of oil encounters during the BP Horizon Oil Spill due to the spawning seasons and across-shelf larval distribution for each species (Fodrie and Heck 2011).&#160;Grey Snapper&#160;undertake spawning migrations to offshore reefs (Starck 1971, Domeier <em>et al.</em> 1996, Domeier and Colin 1997) and this may increase their vulnerability to fishery harvest during summer months, which is also a time of maximum fishing effort due to favourable weather conditions (Burton 2001). In the Caribbean, this species is strongly associated with regions of high human population density (Stallings 2009) and may be threatened by coastal development. Off the west coast of Florida, juvenile <em>L. griseus</em> were infected with a myxozoan parasite with 83% prevalence; these individuals exhibited serious kidney problems, which can increase susceptibility to stress-related mortalities and predation (Holzer <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Adults of this species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect species responses may arise with increasing climate change effects on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Using laboratory-derived thermal limits and IPCC AR4 general circulation models,&#160;Grey Snapper&#160;are predicted to shift northwards with the magnitude dependent on the temperature change (Hare <em>et al. </em>2012). Evidence of a northward shift of this species exists from the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gericke<em> et al.</em> 2014).","<p>In the United States, the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils have size restrictions in place for this species: both recreational and commercial landings from areas three to 200 miles off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and east Florida, harvested individuals must be at least 12 inches in length (TL). In addition, recreational catches are limited to 10 snapper per person per day.</p><p>In Cuba, a ban during the peak reproductive month of July was established; although it was not a permanent regulation since fishing during other spawning months was permitted. In 2008 and 2012, respectively, site nets and long bottom trawls were prohibited. However, long seine nets and traps with small mesh continue to be in use. Since 1982, a minimum catch size of 6 oz (170 g = c. 220 mm) was declared, which research suggests may be too small (R. Claro pers. comm. 2015).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Lutjanus griseus</em> is common and can be highly abundant throughout its range. At present, there is no stock assessment for the Atlantic US coast by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The bulk of Grey Snapper landings in the US South Atlantic (North Carolina-Florida Keys) occur in Florida. Commercial landings along Florida’s east coast declined and fluctuated from 1950 to 2013, ranging from a peak in 1951 of 113.1 mt to 10.9 mt in 2010 (NMFS 2015a). Commercial landings have declined 24-56% over a three generation length range of 12-39 years (NMFS 2015a). Recreational landings of<em> L. griseus </em>from headboat, private recreational and charter boat of Florida’s east coast averaged approximately 170 mt from 1981 to 2014, with a minimum of approximately 63 mt in 1982 and 2010, and a maximum harvest of 335 mt in 2003 (NMFS 2015b). Ault<em> et al</em>. (1998) estimated SPR at 24% suggesting potential overfishing based on data from 1979-1996 in the Florida Keys. Average annual landings between 1986 and 1997 from the south Florida area (Ft. Pierce through the Dry Tortugas; 412.2 mt) were five times greater than those from north Florida (Fernandina Beach through Sebastian; 81.6 mt) (Burton 2001). Additionally, Burton (2001) observed a lack of older, larger Grey Snappers in south Florida, which he postulates may be a consequence of greater fishing pressure in south Florida (F=0.66) compared to north Florida (F=0.16) over the last three decades. As a result,&#160;Grey Snapper&#160;in south Florida may reach a smaller maximum size and younger maximum age in the population, as well as smaller sizes at most ages. This has implications because fecundity is usually proportional to size, age or both; regional population structure and fishing histories should be considered in management decisions.<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Mexico, <em>L. griseus</em> is not considered to be undergoing overfishing and it is unknown whether it is overfished or approaching overfished conditions (NMFS 2015c). Commercial landings of<em> L. griseus </em>from US waters of the Gulf of Mexico increased from 123.1 mt in 1950 to a peak of 423.2 mt in 1983 (NMFS 2015a). This was followed by a steady decline to 107.1 mt in 2013. Considering a three generation length time range of 12-39 years through 2013, commercial landings decreased 23% over 12 years and 60% over 39 years in the US waters of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico combined (NMFS 2015a). Recreational landings increased from almost 567,000 individuals in 1981 to a peak of 3.54 million individuals in 1984; landings have been fairly stable at about 0.5-1.5 million individuals since 1985 (NMFS 2015b).<br/><br/>In Cuba, this species is considered abundant (Claro and Lindeman 2008); however, spawning aggregations (June through August) have declined (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). In southwestern Cuba, <em>L. griseus</em> was the most common snapper in visual censuses of mangroves, reefs, and artificial reefs (Claro and Lindeman 2008). This species is exploited off Cuba, where fishery statistics are combined with <em>L. cyanopterus</em>, but with highest fishing effort concentrated on<em> L. griseus</em>. Commercial catches of <em>L. griseus</em> in Cuba grew from about 400 mt in 1962 to almost 1,300 mt in 1981. The primary increases took place in the southwest zone, possibly relating to the overfishing of <em>L. synagris </em>(Claro 1991), with a subsequent focus on <em>L. griseus</em> (R. Claro pers. comm. 2015). Total landings for this species peaked in the late 1970s in Cuba and declined after 1982 (from 1,200 mt to about 440 mt in 2010). Fishing effort declined after 1990 due to socioeconomic factors; this may have resulted in population recoveries after 2000, since 2005, the catch has maintained at around 400 mt (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Both species spawn during the same period and are targeted by fishermen when they form aggregations (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, on the Gulf of Mexico side of Cuba, catches for this species are very low, and there is no decline. <em>Lutjanus griseus</em> is also an important species for recreational fisheries; however, no known data are currently available. Ocean circulation modelling suggest a relatively low probability of snapper larval connectivity between the western Caribbean (particularly from south of Cuba) to US waters (Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>This species is caught as bycatch in the commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) off Mexico. This species is sold primarily in the domestic markets of Mexico City and Guadalajara (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial landings reported from Mexico averaged 214 mt annually from 2005 to 2011 (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department 2011). It is often reported in mixed-snapper catch categories and can be misidentified with smaller adult Cubera Snapper, <em>L. cyanopterus</em>. Analyses of F/Fmsy ratio versus B/Bmsy ratio and comparative spawning potential ratio (SPR) indicate that <em>L. griseus </em>is overfished (with overfishing still occurring) in Puerto Rico (Ault <em>et al</em>. 2008).

Settlement and juvenile grow-out occurs in shallow seagrasses and mangrove-associated habitats that can be locally threatened by coastal development.","The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council includes this species in the Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan and has size restrictions of at least 12 inches in length (TL) for recreational and commercial landings from three to 200 miles off North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and east Florida. Amendment 35 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP in 2015 removed <em>L. jocu</em> from the FMP because it is rarely harvested (SAFMC 2015). It had already been removed from the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Resources FMP. Recreational catches are limited to 10 snapper per person per day. The same rules apply within State of Florida waters. Although it is unknown whether this species is underfished or undergoing overfishing throughout the US South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, there are no plans for rebuilding or taking additional management actions (NMFS 2010). In the US federal waters of Puerto Rico, <em>L. jocu</em> is managed under the CFMC’s Reef Fish FMP’s Snapper Unit 3 using annual commercial catch limits and recreational catch limits.<br/><br/>In Cuba, the minimum length is 24 cm FL, and a maximum size of 4 kg to avoid the consumption of ciguatoxic specimens. In St. Thomas, Grammanik Bank, a spatial/temporal closure from February to April was established in 2005 in federal waters for <em>L. jocu</em> and <em>L. cyanopterus</em> (Kadison<em> et al</em>. 2006). In Brazil, this species is fished heavily in part due to the absence of ciguatera in comparison to the Caribbean. Management measures in many countries are not present or inconsistently enforced. More availability of landings time series for this species would aid management. This species occurs in marine protected areas of variable effectiveness throughout its range.",Decreasing,"Adults of this species can be locally abundant in deeper waters throughout the tropical portion of its range. This species is one of the largest in the region and can be ciguatoxic, especially larger individuals. Total fishing effort in Florida increased in the 1980s to 1990s because of greater average fishing power and a larger recreational fishery (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998). Under the Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan (FMP) of the US South Atlantic, it is unknown if <em>L. jocu</em> was overfished, approaching overfished condition, or undergoing overfishing (NMFS 2011) as it has not been through a stock assessment process. Importantly for federal waters of the US Atlantic, Amendment 35 to the Snapper-Grouper FMP would remove <em>L. jocu</em> from the FMP because it is rarely harvested (SAFMC 2015). Analyses of F/Fmsy versus B/Bmsy ratios and comparative spawning potential ratio (SPR) indicated that <em>L. jocu</em> was overfished (with overfishing occurring) in the Florida Keys from 1979 to 1996 based on SPR of 25% (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998). Commercial landings in US waters of the Atlantic ranged from 0.0 to 0.6 mt per year from 1988 to 2012 (NMFS 2015a), with no clear trends. Recreational landings ranged from less than 30 individuals to over 15,000 individuals, from 1981 to 2015, but are considered very imprecise (NMFS 2015b).<br/><br/>Commercial landings in US waters of the Gulf of Mexico ranged from 0.1 to 1.9 mt per year from 1991 to 2013, declining from 1.9 mt in 2004 to 0.3 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). Recreational landings ranged from over 21,000 individuals to less than 100 individuals, but these estimates were very imprecise (NMFS 2015b). Under the Reef Fish Resources FMP of the US Gulf of Mexico, it was unknown if if <em>L. jocu </em>was approaching overfished condition or undergoing overfishing (NMFS 2010). In 2011,<em> L. jocu</em> was removed from the FMP. Large aggregations of this species have been recorded in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico (Hickerson <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/>&#160;<br/>This species is caught as bycatch in the commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) off Mexico. It is sold in the domestic markets of mainly Mexico City and Guadalajara (SAGARPA 2012). This species is not in the FAO online database. It is common in Cuba, although of less importance than several other snappers in the fishery (García-Cagide <em>et al.</em> 1999). Total catches until the 1980s were estimated at about 20-25 mt yearly, but have sharply declined since 1980 including spawning aggregations (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Claro and Valle 2013). Non-commercial catches (subsistence and recreational) may be more important, but little statistical information is available. Ocean circulation modelling suggests a low probability of snapper larval connectivity between the western Caribbean (particularly from south of Cuba) to US waters (Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Overfishing of this species was not reported in research in Puerto Rico where this species is considered ciguatoxic. An estimated SPR of 37.2% put this species above the standard for sustainability (30%) in 2008 (Ault <em>et al</em>. 2008, Table 3). Thisspecies is not harvested in many Lesser Antillean countries due to the potential for ciguatoxic individuals (Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Venezuela, it is fished with many gears by commercial and artisanal fishers using trammel nets, traps and hook and line (Cervigon <em>et al</em>. 1993).&#160;<br/><br/>In most or all of Brazil, this species is not ciguatoxic. Exploitation in northeastern Brazil has been substantial since the 1970s (Frédou and Ferreira 2005) and it can be one of the main reef species in artisanal and commercial fisheries with 665 mt landed in 2005 (IBAMA 2007). In the Abrolhos reef system in Bahia, Brazil, <em>L. jocu </em>ranked third in percentage of snappers censused (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). Estimates of fishery mortality in Brazil varied from 0.002 to 1.042 depending on the scenario considered; e.g., the stock of <em>L. jocu</em> from 1996 to 2000 was considered over or fully exploited in Northeast Brazil given the calculated M= 0.12 (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009). The conservative biological reference point of F0.1 = 0.036 is 85% below current levels which suggests a large reduction in fishery mortality was needed. In northeastern and central Brazil, it is was considered fully exploited in Vasconcellos <em>et al</em>. (2007, 2011) and the non-long term landings information suggest at least a 30% decline in landings and probably biomass has occurred across Brazil.

It has adapted quickly and successfully in this region, spread rapidly throughout the archipelago and over a large range of depths. Although some concern regarding the effect of this introduced species on native snappers has been expressed, research has shown that, as an adult, this species shows little aggression towards native snappers, does not share the same depth and feeding habitat with most native species, overlaps little in diet, and is not a frequent predator or prey of native species (Parrish<em> et al</em>. 2000). However, other sources claim this species forms """"marauding schools"""" which feed on the eggs, larvae, and small adult native fishes and feeds voraciously on crabs and polychaetes (Friedlander 2004).<br/><br/>Snappers make up 45% of the bottomfish harvest in the western Pacific, and total snapper harvests increased by 6% from 2004 to 2005. &#160;Boat-based fishing methods account for 98% of the total catch.

Evidence of overfishing exists for various regions (see Population section). Juveniles of the species are also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls in many regions. Both <em>L. synagris</em> and <em>L. griseus</em> were estimated to have had a high risk of oil encounters from the BP Horizon Oil Spill based on spawning season and cross-shelf larval distribution for each species (Fodrie and Heck 2011).<br/><br/>This species is commercially important throughout its range. In Brazil, as other species in the lutjanid complex decline, this species is growing in relative importance in catches, becoming a primary target in several states. Although this species is considered overexploited in Brazil, few management measures are in place; primarily consisting of marine protected areas (Resende<em> et al.</em> 2003, Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). Substantial fishing of spawning aggregations in eastern Brazil has been reported (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation may be occurring in Cuba due to hyper-salinization of inner lagoons, damage to <em>Thalassia </em>beds from hurricanes, and changes in water circulation in coastal areas (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Juveniles occur in shallow habitats such as mangroves, seagrasses and hardbottom, which can all be subject to degradation or elimination by coastal construction projects (e.g., Lindeman and Snyder 1999). Adults of the species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","There are catch, season and gear limits on this species in the jurisdictions of the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Fishery Management Councils. In US federal waters, <em>L. synagris</em> is regulated commercially by an 8 inch TL minimum size limit without a trip limit, and recreational fishing regulations include an 8 inch TL size limit within a 10 snapper aggregate in the South Atlantic and 20 within a reef fish aggregate in the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan includes a seasonal prohibition on possessing Lane Snapper from April through June.&#160;There is a minimum catch size of 25 cm (FL) for this species in Bermuda (Luckhurst <em>et al.</em> 2000). Since 1978, Lane Snapper fishing in the Gulf of Batabano, Cuba, has been banned during the three-month spawning period, and an annual limited quota was introduced (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). A permanent closure was established in shallow waters adjacent to the spawning site in 1987. Despite these two protective measures being in place for more than 15 years total, there was no evident recovery. After 1995, limited recovery was observed in the Gulf of Batabanó, and some fishing of spawning aggregations was authorized; however, the further reduction in catch that occurred in the following years resulted in a prohibition of set nets over the entire Cuban platform in 2008 (Claro<em> et al.</em> 2009). The protection of spawning aggregations in all regions is highly advised. This species occurs in marine protected areas of variable effectiveness. Identification of actual spawning sites within and near existing marine protected areas remains a significant challenge (Frietas <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Decreasing,"The species is not prominent in catches above the Cape Canaveral area of east Florida. Commercial landings total 166.1 mt over 62 years in the US Atlantic. In the US Atlantic, commercial landings ranged from 0.1 in 1952 to a peak of 15.7 mt in 1979, declining to 0.5 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). Considering a three generation length range of 15-18 years to 2013, commercial landings for this species has declined 84% over 12 years, 90% over 23 years, and 72% over 30 years (NMFS 2015a). Currently, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council considers the stock not overfished nor undergoing overfishing. Most US catches are in state, not federal, waters. In Florida, peak landings for commercial and recreational fisheries, 480 mt, were in 1984 with substantial declines on the order of approximately 70% through 2013 (FWRI 2014, Figures 2 and 3). The spawning potential ratio (SPR) in the Florida Keys was estimated at 74% in Ault <em>et al</em>. (1998). In the US Gulf of Mexico, <em>L. synagris</em> is not considered to be undergoing overfishing and it is unknown whether it is overfished or approaching overfished conditions (NMFS 2015b). This species is more prominent in the US Gulf of Mexico than in the US Atlantic, where commercial landings of <em>L. synagris</em> increased from 12.8 mt in 1965 to a peak of 66.5 mt in 1991, followed by a steady decline to 11.4 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). The commercial landings demonstrate a decline of 82.9% over 23 years from 1991 to 2013, which falls within the 15-18 year three generation length range. However, peak landings may represent a shift in the fishery toward this species as Red Snapper,<em> L. campechanus</em>, and some groupers declined. Recreational landings fluctuated greatly over the last 35 years, starting with 58 mt in 1981, with a peak catch of 457 mt in 1984, a second peak catch of 235 mt in 1991, and a minimum catch of 10.5 mt in 2011 (NMFS 2015c). The preliminary estimate of recreational landings for 2015 is 57 mt (NMFS 2015c). Based on these two peak landings dates, the recreational landings declined by 87.5% over 32 years to 75.7% over 25 years by 2015.<br/><br/>In Mexico, commercial landings increased from 100 mt in 1970 to a peak in 2,745 mt in 1993, followed by a substantial decline to 142 mt in 2013 (FAO 2015), representing a decline in landings of 95% in 21 years. This species is caught in the commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus </em>(Red Snapper) off Mexico and juveniles are caught as bycatch in shrimp trawls (SAGARPA 2012).<br/><br/>Catch landings on the Cuban Shelf declined more than 50% since the peak of the fishery in the 1970s, and the fishery is considered to be highly exploited (Baisre 2000, Baisre <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are over 40 years of time series showing sharp declines in abundance of spawning aggregations in Cuba (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). This species was the most important commercial fish of the Cuban shelf until the mid-1970s when stocks greatly declined in the most productive region, the Gulf of Batabano. Reported commercial landings increased from 1,000 mt in 1959 to 4,300 mt in 1969; landings remained fairly stable until 1978 (FAO 2015). Reported landings decreased to about 1,300 mt by 1980, followed by nearly 20 years of variable but low abundance, including a low of 694 mt in 2005, to 1,205 mt in 2013 (FAO 2015). Overall, landings decreased by 72% over 45 years, however considering the three generation length range, commercial landings declined by 35% over the last 30 years and 43% over the last 12 years to 2013 (FAO 2015). In the 1980s, some conventional measures of fishery protection were implemented; however, recovery of stocks did not occur. Besides the Gulf of Batabano, spawning aggregations were also intensively fished by trawling in the Archipelago Sabana-Camagüey and Archipelago Jardines de la Reina. Protective measures that were introduced were generally not successful (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>This species is important in commercial and recreational fisheries in the Caribbean and in Bermuda. In some areas of the Caribbean, this species appears to have experienced significant declines prior to the mid-1970s, but populations since the mid-1990s may be relatively stable but at lower numbers (Baisre 2000, Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stalling 2009). In a 15 year study period (1994-2008) in the greater Caribbean based on REEF online database (www.reef.org), this species was sighted evenly or at increasing frequencies even in areas of increasing human density (Stalling 2009).<br/><br/>Landings in Bermuda from 1975 to 1992 showed a general increase through the mid-1980s reached a peak of 15,165 kg in 1987; 80 to 90% of landings were derived from fish-pots (Luckhurst 1996). In an effort to maintain catch levels, there was an expansion of the commercial line fishery, with landings increasing to 20,000 kg in the two years following a fish-pot ban. Commercial landings stabilized at approximately 1,000 kg for the next four years, followed by a significant decline in 1997 to under 10,000 kg. However, it is unknown if this decline was effort-related (Luckhurst 1996). The presence of older year classes in studies conducted in 2000 suggest that the exploitation rate in the Bermuda fishery is not yet sufficiently high to have removed them at the present level of fishing mortality (Luckhurst <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/>From 1988 to 2008,<em> L. synagris</em> was one of the most frequently caught species of fish in Puerto Rican commercial landings (Matos-Caraballo 2000). Yield-per-recruit analyses of lane snapper in Puerto Rico showed that yield increased as the length-at-capture was increased to about 7.9 inches fork length (FL) and when the instantaneous fishing mortality (F) was higher than 0.5 per year (Acosta and Appeldoorn 1992). In Colombia, this species can be the most important lutjanid in the fishery (Acero and Garzon 1985). The species is also highly valued in Venezuela (Cervigon 1993). In the Suriname commercial groundfish fishery, a 79% reduction of daily catch per unit effort of <em>L. synagris</em> was observed from 0.498 mt/day in 1998 to 0.103 mt/day in 2011 (Seijo 2013). Additionally, <em>L. synagris</em> is also caught as part of the Venezuelan Red Snapper fleet fishery (Seijo 2013). Recent genetic studies of&#160;<em>Lutjanus synagris</em>&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico (Karlsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009) and the wider Caribbean (Gold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) found significant differences in microsatellites and mtDNA between subpopulations. In particular, in the Gulf of Mexico there appear to be two subpopulations: one in the western Gulf and one in the eastern Gulf, with the western Gulf subpopulation providing more migrants to the eastern subpopulation than the reverse (Karlsson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009). Although the subpopulation in the Florida Keys was significantly different that in the US Caribbean (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and St. Croix), there appeared to be more migration from the US Caribbean to the Florida Keys than the reverse (Gold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Bio-physically coupled ocean circulation modelling suggested limited low levels of snapper larval connectivity between sites around Cuba to U.S. waters (Paris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>This species is important in many reef fisheries of Brazil (Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and considered overexploited in many areas (e.g., Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2006, REVIZEE 2006). In an assessment off northeast Brazil from 1996 to 2000, the biological reference point mortality (0.029) for this species was 85% less than current fishing mortality, a sign of overexploitation, and over a period of four years, estimated biomass declines occurred from 13,100 to 12,000 individuals in northeastern Brazil (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009). According to FAO (2015), commercial landings have increased from 506 mt in 1995 to 1,689 mt in 2013. In a stock assessment conducted by Klippel <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2005) in eastern Brazil, the stock was considered to be moderately overexploited. In the Abrolhos Reef System, the species ranked third among lutjanids in percentage of total biomass (Francini-Filho 2008).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

This measure was primarily for protection of Speckled Hind and Warsaw Grouper and is no longer in effect. There is a recreational fishery 12' TL size limit for <em>L. vivanus</em>, as well as a five individuals per person/day in addition to the aggregate 10 snapper per person/day bag limit in the SAFMC. There is also a commercial and recreational annual catch limit (ACL) in the SAFMC jurisdiction. In Cuba, the minimum size is 12 inches (≈230 g, 23 cm FL). In Puerto Rico there is a minimum catch size of 16 inches.",Decreasing,"This species is found in deeper waters, off insular and continental shelves, and can be relatively less exploited than other more shallow lutjanid species in the Caribbean (Tabash and Sierra 1996) and in Brazil (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2006). It&#160;can be an important component of southern US, Caribbean and Brazilian deepwater fisheries.<br/><br/><strong>United States<br/></strong>In the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the region with most US landings, commercial landings increased from 1.7 mt in 1984 to 145.8 mt in 1992, then decreased to 17.9 mt in 2013 (NMFS pers. comm. 2015). This change in landings probably reflects management actions such as deepwater grouper regulations in the early 1990s, with additional quotas added by 2004. In North Carolina, this species comprised a minor component of the fishery at Snowy Edge and other offshore areas in the 1970s, but was not caught in 2005-2006 (Rudershausen <em>et al</em>. 2008). Ault <em>et al</em>. (1998) estimated the spawning potential ratio (SPR) to be approximately 5% of the unexploited SPR in the Florida Keys, well below 30% US SPR, but this is a small portion of its range. NMFS recreational landings for the US southeast and US Gulf of Mexico ranged from zero to over 300,000 individuals yearly between 1981 and 2013 and recreational harvest estimates are very imprecise (NMFS pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico<br/></strong>This species is considered part of a multispecies fishery off Mexico, where <em>L. campechanus</em> represents 90% of the total catch (SAGARPA 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Cuba<br/></strong>In Cuba this species is considered to be the most abundant of the deep water snappers, and currently is underexploited because it is not targeted. During the 1980s, catches fluctuated between 80 and 160 annual mt. However, during the 1990s, catches greatly declined due to a reduction in the fishing effort, fluctuating between 40 and 93 mt since 1995 (Claro and Lindeman 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Caribbean<br/></strong>It is one of the most important deep water species in Venezuela, the Guyanas, Trinidad and Tobago, and Lesser Antilles, but there are little fisheries data for these regions.&#160;In December 2011, the Caribbean Fishery Management Council conducted a stock assessment of <em>L. vivanus</em>&#160;in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands; however, stock abundance and biomass estimates remain unknown due to limited data (SEDAR 26 2011). In a survey of deep water snappers off of St. Croix between 1984 and 1997, there were very few observations of this species to allow for firm conclusions, and the two different methods for calculating nominal CPUE gave conflicting results: one showing no decline and another showing 60% decline over the 13 year period (Cass-Calay and Valle-Esquivel 2003). In Puerto Rico, landings for this species reached a peak in the early 1980s around 250 t/year, but have been relatively stable over the past 30 years (1971-2002) at around 100 to 130 t/year (Cummings and Matos-Caraballo 2003). However, much of the catch in Puerto Rico is likely juveniles, as 97% of individuals landed in 1994-1997 were under the minimum maturity length of 41 cm reported by Figuerola (1991) (Rosario 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil<br/></strong>In Brazil, <em>L. vivanus</em> is more abundant at the shelf break (100-300 m according to Martins <em>et al</em>. 2005) and is considered one of the primary components of the deeper snapper fisheries (Olavo <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, this species represented only 6.8% of the landings in regions where the effort is concentrated in shallower areas of 40-60 m, such as the Abrolhos region (Olavo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The stock has been regarded as fully exploited in Northeast Brazil (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009) and overexploited along the central coast since the 1990s (Klippel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Martins <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Habitat degradation due to coastal development and pollution in estuaries could also represent a major threat to this species.,"In southern Brazil, the minimum catch size for this species is 25 cm (with the exception of trawling) (IN-MMA-53-2005).&#160;There are no specific restrictions for gear type or fishing zone. Despite its status as fully exploited off Para (Brazil), there has been no continuous data collection on its biology or fishery since 2000. Data on its occurrence level as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries is limited and therefore not incorporated into stock assessments (Nahum and Fredou pers. comm. 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is common and abundant in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil, and scarce in the northeastern of the Brazil where there are few estuaries and the bottom is mostly constituted of rocks (Yamaguti 1979, J. Da Silva pers. comm. 2009). Data from the Dr. Fridtjof Nansen cruises in 1998, report that croakers represent 18% of standing biomass off Suriname and 39% off Guyana, and that&#160;<em>M. ancylodon&#160;</em>was&#160;the most important bycatch species (O. Aguilera pers. comm. 2009).&#160;Genetic studies of populations from Venezuela to Bahia indicates that there is a panmitic population in the northern portion of its distribution from Venezuela to Maranhão, Brazil and a distinct population occurring in the northeast from Pernambuco and Bahia. The limit of distribution of the two groups was not defined due to lack of samples from Piauí to Paraíba (Santos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Based on morphometric, meristics and otolith aspects, it was proposed four populations of&#160;<em>M. ancylodon</em>&#160;in the southwestern and southern Brazilian coast: one composed by Espírito Santo population, other by Rio de Janeiro, the third population along São Paulo, Paraná and northern Santa Catarina state coasts and the fourth group along Rio Grande do Sul coast (Yamaguti 1979). Based on cytochrome b analysis from mitochondrial DNA, there are three distinct groups in this area, one composed by Espírito Santo, other by São Paulo and Paraná, and the third group with Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Argentina populations (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In Venezuela, landings by trawl fisheries increased from zero to 4,000 t between 1987-1996 (nine years), with no consistent trend in CPUE (Alio&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1997).&#160;According to Brazilian fishery statistics, catches of&#160;<em>M. ancylodon</em>&#160;have been declining. Total catch in 2006 was 58% of that in 1999 (www.ibama.gov.br). However, in 2007, catch was higher than what was reported in previous years.&#160;Considering traditional stock assessment (Jones´s length cohort analysis) and data from the REVIZEE program, this species is considered fully exploited off northern Brazil with an estimated biomass of 7770 t (IKEDA&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Programa REVISEE-MMA 2006) and a mean fishing mortality of 1.21 year<sup>-1</sup>. In terms of relative abundance, the mean CPUE is 2.28 kg/ha (compiled from shrimp trawls) off northern Brazil (ASANO-FILHO&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004a).&#160;Data from fishery statistics (IBAMA) show that it was abundant in artisanal and commercial fisheries along the northern coast, with landings averaging 4,077 t/year between 1995-2007 (12 years) (CEPNOR, IBAMA 2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008).&#160;It is one of the most important resources in Amazonian fisheries, where it comprises 9% of the estuarine/marine landings in Pará State (Nahum and Fredou pers. comm. 2009).&#160;It is one of the most important demersal fishery resources&#160;in Maranhão (Brazil),&#160;with landings averaging 3,040 t/year&#160;between 2001-2007 (6 years) (IBAMA 2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2007a, 2007b, 2008). The CPUE in Maranhao is less than in Para&#160;(Ikeda 2003). In estuarine waters off Caeté, Bragança, Pará, it had a mean relative biomass of 0.29 g/m<sup>2</sup> (Camargo and Isaac 1998).&#160;Off Para, it is caught mostly between March-May and in Maranhão, between January-July (Ikeda 2003). Individual sizes of fish captured in the northern Brazil fishery ranged between 1.7-43.3 cm TL, indicating that both juveniles and adults were exploited (Programa REVISEE-MMA 2006). Between 1976-1990 (14 years), the average length of individuals declined and shrimp fishery fleets captured juveniles, which caused population declines in southwestern Brazil. Between 1974-2009 (35 years), landings off Sao Paulo declined by 94% (Carneiro 2005). As a result, CPUE for this species also declined by about 60% between 1998-2002 (four years). Landings and CPUE were stable at low levels between 2000- 2005 (Institute of Fisheries Sao Paulo). After 1998, fishing effort switched to target other species with higher economic interest. This species&#160;has&#160;historically recovered quickly after delayed declines from intensive fishing (L. de Miranda pers. comm. 2009). Catch in Argentina was relatively stable at around 200 tonnes between 1998-2008 (10 years), while catch in&#160;Uruguay during those same years averaged 2,000 tonnes per year.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

More than 73% of reported landings are incidental to large offshore longline fisheries, and other major fisheries are the directed recreational fisheries of the USA and other countries (Restrepo <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2003). Protections efforts for blue marlin have continued to decrease in recent years, as deeper longline gear is introduced (Uozumi 1999).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic new fleets have harvested large catches of Blue Marlin,  including artisanal fish aggregating devices (FAD) fisheries in the  eastern Caribbean islands and a new artisanal fleet of small longliners  operating off Brazil between 18°S and 30°S. This species is primarily  taken as bycatch by longline fisheries, but also by purse seines, by  some artisanal gears which are the only fisheries targeting marlins and  also by various sport fisheries located on both sides of the Atlantic. The increasing use of anchored FADs by various artisanal and sport  fisheries is causing greater vulnerability of these stocks (STECF 2009).  For example, over the last fifteen years, Antillean artisanal fleets  have increased the use of Moored Fish Aggregating Devices (MFADs) to  capture pelagic fish. Catches of Blue Marlin caught around MFADs are  known to be significant but reports on these catches made to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) are  very incomplete (ICCAT 2006).","This is a highly migratory species, listed under Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In some areas, long-lining is restricted to protect fish stocks for sport fishing. Size limitations, encouragement of catch-and-release sport fishing, and recommendations for using circle hooks instead of J-hooks are measures designed to increase survival in catch-and-release sport fishing (Pine <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008, Serafy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009). Marlin species are a special case because bycatch in the longline fisheries concentrating primarily on tunas causes the majority of fishery mortality (&gt;90%) for marlin (Kitchell <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2004). In the Pacific, marlin are most frequently captured on the shallow hooks of a longline set (those close to the floats), and removing less than 15% of the hook sets adjacent to floats would decrease marlin catch by as much as 50% (Kitchell <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2004).<br/><br/>For Blue Marlin in the Atlantic, the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT–SCRS) in 2008 asked the Commission, at a minimum, to continue the management measures already in place because marlins have not yet recovered. The Commission should take steps to assure that the reliability of the recent fishery information improves in order to provide a basis for verifying possible future rebuilding of the stocks. Improvements are needed in the monitoring of the fate and number of dead and live releases, with verification from scientific observer programs; verification of current and historical landings from some artisanal and industrial fleets; and complete and updated relative abundance indices from CPUE data for the major fleets. Should the Commission wish to increase the likelihood of success of the current management measures of the marlin rebuilding plan, further reduction in mortality would be needed, including: implementing plans to improve compliance of current regulations; encouraging the use of alternative gear configurations, including certain types of circle hooks, hook/bait combinations etc., in fisheries where its use has been shown to be beneficial; and broader application of time/area catch restrictions.<br/><br/>Given the recent importance of the catch from artisanal fisheries, and to increase the likelihood of recovery of marlin stocks, the Commission should consider regulations that control or reduce the fishing mortality generated by these fisheries. The Commission should encourage continued research on development of methods to incorporate this information into stock assessments in order to provide a basis for increasing the certainty with which management advice can be provided.<br/><br/>The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) stresses the need for correct identification and reporting of billfish species in all&#160; fisheries. Furthermore, STECF notes that the 2007 ICCAT–SCRS report indicated the potential for the stocks of blue marlin and white marlin to recover to the BMSY level. However, recent increases in catches of Blue Marlin by artisanal fisheries on both sides of the Atlantic may compromise the effectiveness of the ICCAT plan (STECF 2009).<br/><br/>Recent analyses suggest that the recovery of blue marlin stock might proceed faster than would have been estimated at the 2000 assessment, provided catches remain at the level estimated for 2004. Some signs of stabilization in the abundance trend are apparent in the most recent catch per unit of effort data of Blue Marlin (2000–2004) Recommendations [Rec. 00-13], [Rec. 01-10] and finally [Rec. 02-13] placed additional catch restrictions for Blue Marlin and White Marlin. The first established that the annual amount of Blue Marlin that can be harvested by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels and retained for landing must be no more than 33% for White Marlin and 50% for Blue Marlin of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is greater. That recommendation established that all Blue Marlin and White Marlin brought to pelagic longline and purse seine vessels alive shall be released in a manner that maximizes their survival. The provision of this paragraph does not apply to marlins that are dead when brought along the side of the vessel and that are not sold or entered into commerce. Catches of both species have declined since 1996–99, the period selected as the reference period by the recommendations. Since 2002, the year of implementation of the last of these two recommendations, the catch of Blue Marlin has been below the 50% value recommended by the Commission. This analysis represents only longline caught marlin even though the recommendations referred to the combined catch of pelagic longline and purse seine because the catch estimates of billfish by-catch from purse seine vessels are more uncertain than those from longline. More countries have started reporting data on live releases in 2006. Additionally, more information has come about, for some fleets, on the potential for using gear modifications to reduce the bycatch and increase the survival of marlins (ICCAT 2007).<br/><br/>Catches of Blue Marlin in the Indian Ocean are very poorly reported and there is need of better data to evaluate the condition of the Indian Ocean stock.",Decreasing,"<span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The most recent stock assessment for Blue Marlin (ICCAT 2007) used a Bayesian Surplus Production model to estimate biomass from 1990 through 2006. The remaining data series (1956–1989) are based on biomass estimates from the previous stock assessment (ICCAT 2002). Population declines were examined using a generation length estimated between 4.5 and 6 years. Over a three generation length period of 14 years, the decline was 60% and over a three generation length period of 18 years, the decline was 64%. These declines were calculated using a linear regression over each of the time periods examined. Population reduction for Atlantic blue marlin was therefore estimated to be between 60% and 64%. For all of the models for which the stock productivity was constrained to be near the productivity estimated by the last full assessment, the current biomass was estimated to be at or below biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and current fishing mortality rates were above FMSY.

We therefore used estimated catch data from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) (Hinton, unpublished data 2011), which were the only available recent data. We assume that effort has remained stable or has increased over the time period examined. Based on catch data and a generation length of 4.5–6 years, we estimated declines of 5% over 14 years (1996–2009) and 19% over 18 years (1992–2009) using linear regression.

The CPUE decline for Japanese longliners in the Seychelles was 79.5% over 14 years and 56.9% over 18 years (Figure 40, IOTC 2009). For each time period considered, an average of the declines in Northwest Australia and the Seychelles was used to characterize the population in the Indian Ocean.

It was indicated that larger tarpon tended to be caught in more recent years, this may be evidence of size selectivity by the fishers to retain larger fish for display or acknowledgement. The results of this study indicated that there may be a lack of recruitment of tarpon into the Texas fishery, especially from Mexico, after 1960, perhaps indicative of decline in nursery habitat.&#160; Alternatively, this could be due to natural fluctuations in recruitment.<br/><br/>Evidence of over-exploitation was observed in the southwest coast of Florida, in the decline in average length in the catches (Bortone 2008). Moreover, inshore waters where juvenile tarpon occur (Shenker <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span> 2002) are subject to habitat degradation due to increased human activities (Bortone 2005). It should be noted, however, that Bortone used scales largely collected and posted from 1910–1930; very few scales were from collections after 1980. This coincides with a marked shift in Florida in the 1970s and 1980s towards a catch-and-release fishery (Guindon 2011).<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on tarpon has been studied in two size classes of Tarpon. Short-term, post-release mortality of adult tarpon in the recreational fishery is due predominately to predation, and to a lesser extent physiological stress and injury. In the absence of predation, estimated post-release mortality is 5% for the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida. Other factors affecting survival of adult tarpon were the swimming condition of the tarpon at the time of release and hook location. The level of sub-lethal physiological stress was positively correlated with angling duration, handling time, and body size, especially in adult tarpon, whereas sub-adult tarpon showed less stress effects from angling (Guindon 2011). No short-term mortality was observed on juvenile tarpon released into a saltwater pond absent of sharks, and only one suffered mortality 43-hours after release. Delayed morality rates of adult tarpon are yet unknown.<br/><br/>There have been reported cases of ciguatera poisoning from ingesting tarpon. Injuries (and some deaths) are also associated with anglers attempting to catch this species due to their large size and thrashing power when hooked/pulled into a boat (Morey 2000, Hill 2002).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite their ecological and economic importance, recreational fishery regulations  for tarpon in the United States and abroad differ regionally. Alabama and Georgia have size limits and bag limits (one per person per day in Georgia, in Alabama a $50 tag is needed). North and South Carolina have no minimum size requirements and the limit  is one fish per person per day. In Florida, catch and release is the only fishing method allowed. In Louisiana and Mississippi, there  are no regulations. In Florida and Texas<strong>,</strong> a permit is required to  harvest or possess a tarpon (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation  Commission, K. Guindon and R. Ward pers. comm. 2011). This permit allows two tarpon per permit-holder to be caught and killed per day. Catch information (location and size) must be reported by the angler to&#160;Florida Marine Research Institute. The establishment of this permit program has greatly reduced the number of tarpon killed annually. Before the permit program was in place, in 1989 it was estimated that 342 tarpon were caught and killed by anglers. In 1998, it was estimated the number of tarpon caught and killed by anglers was reduced to only 70 (Burnham 2005). Current management regulations in&#160;Mexico<strong>&#160;</strong>require a fishing permit with gear restricted to one rod and reel (line with a maximum test of 60 kg (130 lbs) and one hook per angler. The bag limit is two fish per angler per day with a request to practice catch and release. Tarpon fishing is not allowed in protected areas or reserves. In Mexico, the limit is two fish per person per day, but no minimum size requirement exists. It is recommended that regulatory measures be implemented specific to conditions for each Mexican region including the establishment of a minimum catch size that promotes growth and reproduction of the species, the implementation of a logbook to record effort, monitoring of fishing tournaments, and promoting the practice of catch and release (SAGARPA 2012). In Belize, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, tarpon are catch-and-release only. <br/><br/>In an  effort to conserve fish stocks and their habitats, many countries are  using marine protected areas in conjunction with existing fisheries  regulations to build sustainable fisheries and protect marine  biodiversity. Catch-and-release is commonly practised by recreational  anglers with a strong conservation ethic who travel to the region. Current levels of international harvest and by-catch should be quantified, and the tertiary effects of catch-and-release fishing on tarpon should be determined to help maintain, if present, or create, if needed, a sustainable fishery.<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on&#160;<em>Megalops atlanticus</em>&#160;continues to be studied. Edwards (1998) found that release mortality for this species is low when proper precautions are taken, including releasing in a short period of time and allowing the fish to remain in the water while being released. Fish that were hooked in the jaw also had decreased release mortality and recovered quickly (Edwards 1998).</p><span class=""""sheader51""""><span class=""""sheader51""""><span

has been no formal stock assessment of Tarpon in any portion of the species' range; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that populations of Atlantic Tarpon appear to have declined from historic levels throughout their range (Adams&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.</span>&#160;in review). Although patchy, data on total commercial landings in Central and South America show large historical declines. Total global landings of&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">M. atlanticus&#160;</span>declined 84.5% between 1965 and 2007 (4,600 metric tons versus 712 metric tons), particularly in Brazil, and mostly during the early years of that time period, reflecting a drop in population size, not a change in fishery effort (FAO 2011). Using a generation time of 12.7 years (Froese and Pauly 2008), the estimated decline in FAO landings over three generations (38 years, from 1969 to 2007) is at least 60%. Although this decline is driven largely from regional commercial harvest, specifically landings from Brazil, the major trends in population are mirrored in landings data from other regions, albeit from a much smaller magnitude. Therefore, we infer that the global decline in abundance is at least 30% over the last three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Although more of the fishery appears to be trending toward catch and release, historically high levels of harvest (followed by dramatic declines) and continuing harvest in some areas, suggest cause for concern. In addition,&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">M. atlanticus</span>&#160;is a periodic species (Winemiller and Rose 1992), long-lived and late to mature, with correspondingly long generation length (&gt;10 years), which may affect its resistance to and recovery from threats. Species with long generation lengths have correspondingly high population recovery time and are thus typically more susceptible to threats that cause population declines (Collette&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Gulf of Mexico</em>: This species has two distinct populations within the&#160;Gulf of Mexico, one that spawns off the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and follows the coast of Texas to northern waters, and another that spawns offshore near Florida (Gaskill 2010).<br/><br/>Once considered the """"Tarpon Capital of the World"""", Port Aransas in Texas is now virtually devoid of a tarpon population (Ault 2010).&#160;In general, current estimations of abundance for this species are based on anecdotal evidence from the recreational fishery. In Florida, anglers suspect significant regional declines over the last&#160;30–50 years, and anecdotal reports suggest declines compared to historic levels. Little scientific evidence exists to corroborate this. An analysis of the recreational Tarpon fishery in southwest Florida from 1902 through 1998 indicated that a decline in Tarpon captures began after the mid-1930s with a notable decrease during World War II (1941–45). The erratic pattern observed in this fishery could be attributed to the changes in social/recreational aspect of anglers recording data on a Tarpon scale or a decline in Tarpon landed by this fishery. There are no data currently available to test these two hypotheses. There is anecdotal information that the characteristics of the fishery changed from landings to catch-and-release, and there was a decline in recorded landings (White and Brennan 2011, Guindon 2011).&#160;Similar to the reports from Florida, a decline was also observed in Texas in the late 1950s, although this decline appeared to be more dramatic (R. Ward pers. comm. 2011), and continued in the 1960s and 1970s (Winemiller and Dailey 2002). However, length modes did not decline over time as observed in Florida (Holt <em>et al.</em> 2005). Mechanisms for apparent declines may include habitat degradation and overfishing.&#160;Florida state regulations granted Tarpon gamefish status in 1953, so they could not be commercially harvested or sold. By the 1970s, taxidermy was a booming million-dollar industry and Tarpon were killed routinely for mounts (Wade and Robins 1973), but the number of fish mounted each year began to decline in the mid-1970s (Crabtree unpublished data in Guindon 2011). In 1989, a new law was enacted and the harvest of Tarpon became regulated by Florida Statute. The number of harvest permits issued declined from 961 in 1989 to 280 in fiscal year 2009–2010, indicating a greatly reduced intended harvest, and a shift to a fishery that is almost entirely catch-and-release (Nelson 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, unpublished data). In more recent years (1981–2010), most recreational catches of Atlantic Tarpon in the USA occurred along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Applying Florida sales of harvest permits to the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey data for Tarpon caught and released in Florida, (National Marine Fisheries Service, Fisheries Statistics Division pers. comm. 2011), indicates that less than 1% of the total catch is harvested (Guindon 2011).Over the last decade, populations in Florida appear to have remained stable; however, earlier records are statistically unreliable (Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2011). One of the few estimates of a regional population of Atlantic Tarpon came from Boca Grande Pass. An acoustic survey was done in 1993, which estimated the Tarpon population in the Pass during peak spawning season to be between 24,700 and 25,400 individuals (Hedgepeth <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993).&#160;No similar data has been collected nor another population estimate made for this area since this study to determine whether or not abundance has increased or decreased. As this species is not primarily subjected to commercial fisheries, stock assessments have not been carried out throughout its range. Stock assessments or landings records in other parts of this species' range do not exist at present, particularly in developing countries. Off Mexico, this species is considered a highly desirable sportfish where it is targeted by hook and line. It does not sustain a commercial fishery. It is considered underexploited off Mexico&#160;(SAGARPA 2012).</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

It also occurs as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. <br/><br/><strong></strong><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;Of the three whitings&#160;commercially&#160;exploited along the southeastern coast of the United States, this is the most landed with an average of 600 tonnes per year over the past 20 years (National Marine Fisheries Service, pers. comm. quoted in McDowell and Robillard 2013).&#160;Total landings of this species have more than tripled since the 1980s and fishery managers are concerned that such increased fishing pressure may lead to a decline in the population (McDowell and Robillard 2013). A commercial fishery that specifically targeted this species existed between 2003-2005, but was subsequently closed after a right whale calf became entangled in a fishing net (Levesque 2009). Historically, landings are difficult to estimate because the state of Florida never separated whiting landings by species. Nonetheless, based on commercial port sampling records, this was the primary whiting species landed in eastern Florida waters. Between 1986–1995 (nine years), commercial Florida whiting landings ranged from 503,250-1,230,433 lbs (with half occurring in Duval County), CPUE averaged 25 lbs/trip, and body size ranged from 15-28 cm TL.&#160;<p><strong>Mexico:&#160;</strong>In the Yucatan (Mexico), artisanal fishers capture individuals with body sizes ranging from 21-16.2 cm (H.

In Brazil, it is reported as part of mixed catch with other&#160;<em>Menticirrhus&#160;</em>spp. In southern Brazil, landings between 1988-2008 (past 20 years) declined by approximately 25% while effort increased. Between 1998-2008 (past 10 years), catch decline was variable, but relatively stable. It is unlikely that there is additional recruitment from the south. Effort has been increasing in artisanal and industrial fisheries in Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo. It is increasing in economic importance where it is now captured in mixed-catch fisheries off Sao Paulo via pair-trawls, artisanal gill nets, and occurs as bycatch in shrimp trawls. Since 2001, mixed catch for both&#160;<em>Menticirrhus&#160;</em>species in Sao Paulo averaged 800 t per year (includes all gear types with each separate species estimated to represent 50% of this number). It is more abundant in the summertime between Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, which may affect the proportion of its total catch in Rio Grande do Sul. Mixed catch for both&#160;<em>Menticirrhus&#160;</em>species in Rio Grande do Sul peaked in both industrial and artisanal fisheries in 1984 at 650 t followed by a decline to 150 t in 2002 (77% decline over 18 years). Catch in the commercial fishery declined from 550 t to 150 t in 2008 (72% decline) and artisanal catch from the surf zone declined from a peak of 150 t in 1986 to zero tonnes in 2008 (100% decline over past 20 years). Fishermen in the area report that&#160;<em>Menticirrhus</em>&#160;spp. have declined the most of any of the surf zone species.

Stock delineation in the Black Sea is unresolved and landings are reported separately for each country. Whiting is primarily taken as by-catch in mixed fisheries in the region and also by a targeted fishery operating in Turkey.

This action also caused the exclusion of foreign fleets which effectively reduced effort in the Silver Hake fishery. In 2000, bag limits on the small-mesh multispecies fishery were implemented based on net mesh size and gear restrictions to reduce bycatch were set. Recently, the council established annual catch limits and accountability measures for the fishery. In addition to these regulations, fishermen must undergo a permitting process, there is a cap on the amount of bycatch that each vessel may take, and the fishing itself is limited seasonally and spatially.&#160;In Canadian waters, the annual landings quota has been set at 15,000 metric tonnes since 2003 and the fishery is monitored by the Canadian Division of Fisheries and Oceans. The Canadian fleet is also required to use certain gear types aimed at reducing bycatch.",Unknown,"This is a relatively common species in the northern parts of its range, becoming less common south of South Carolina (Cohen <em>et al</em>. 1990). It is often found in large aggregations.<br/><br/>Total global catch peaked in 1965, subsequently declined by 84% over the next five years, increased by 148% over the following three years, and finally declined sharply after new fishery laws were enacted in 1977 that effectively reduced effort by at least 48-90%. Prior to 1977, the bulk of fishing effort was conducted by foreign fleets (Russia, Cuba, and Japan) and was unrestricted. From the early 2000s until present, this species has been targeted by only U.S. and Canadian fleets. Over the past three generation lengths (15 to 21 years), the population of <em>M. bilinearis</em> appears to be stable in Canadian waters (approximately 25% of its global distribution), but has been declining by 46-56% in US waters (approximately 75% of its global distribution). Therefore, the global population is estimated to have declined by approximately 30-45% over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>The U.S. commercial fishery for this species is separated into two stocks: the northern from the Gulf of Maine to Georges Bank and the southern from the southern Georges Bank through the Mid-Atlantic Bight. During the summer, fish from both stocks can co-occur on Georges Bank. During the winter, fish from the northern stock migrate to the Gulf of Maine while the southern stock moves further offshore to the outer shelf and slope. Between 1987-1999 (12 years), U.S. landings were relatively stable, gradually declined by 73% over the next 7 years, and then increased by 68% over the following 4 years (up to year 2010 with 9,600 metric tons). In 2012, U.S. landings were 6,940 metric tons. Recreational fishermen do not target Silver Hake and the species is taken in negligible amounts.<br/><br/>Fishery-independent trawl surveys conducted annually in the fall and spring by the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center collect abundance data for marine species that occur over the U.S. Northeast continental shelf. Although the survey indices are variable, the fall survey suggests declines in biomass indices of 46-56% over 15 to 21 years (three generation lengths). The two most recent stock assessments, published in 2006 and 2011, concluded that both U.S. stocks of the Silver Hake are not overfished and are not undergoing overfishing (Northeast Fisheries Science Center 2006, 2011). However, Lloris <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted that <em>M. bilinearis</em> from United States waters rarely exceeded six years of age during the past few years, which is likely due to fisheries targeting larger individuals. The U.S. stock assessments for Silver Hake recognize a certain amount of uncertainty for the following reasons: trends in population size and fishery removals are not consistent between each other, there is some identification confusion with the Offshore Hake within the fishery (Garcia-Vazquez <em>et al</em>. 2012), and the level of natural mortality due to predators is not yet clearly quantified (Link <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Canadian commercial fishery has been active on the Scotian Shelf, specifically the Emerald and LaHave basins, since 1995. A declining shift in the age composition from predominantly ages 2-4 to 1-2 occurred between the 1970s to the mid-1990s was observed during the transition from the foreign fishery to the domestic fishery. The current landings quota has been set at 15,000 metric tonnes since 2003 and has not been exceeded (averages 11,100 metric tonnes). Total landings are dictated by market demand, not reduced abundance. The Canadian government also maintains fishery-dependent and independent research surveys to advise biomass assessments. According to fishery-independent survey results, population biomass estimates indicate an increasing trend since 2008 and biomass in general has returned to similar levels recorded in the 1980s. Additionally, bycatch represents less than 4% of the total catch monitored by observers (DFO 2013).

Accurate species assessment is required in order to effectively monitor  stock assessment and vanguard against species exploitation.<br/><em></em><br/>South African trawlers began fishing in the 1920s. In 1962, foreign fleets joined South African, Namibian and Angolan fisheries and caught both species (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius paradoxus</em>).&#160;Catches showed a marked increase during 1964-1972, reaching a total of 1,100,000 tonnes in 1975, forcing in 1972 the International Commission for South Eastern Atlantic Fisheries (KCSEAF) to introduce fishery management measures. This increase was a result of the activity of the Soviet Union fleet (655,000 tonnes) and to a lesser extent the Spanish fleets (130,000&#160;tonnes), South Africa (118,000 tonnes) Japan (54,700 tonnes), Cuba (48,000&#160;tonnes) and other countries. After this maximum, the catch dropped to a minimum of nearly 300,000 tonnes in 1981. Catches recovered to about 500,000 tonnes around 1985 and decreased again to 200,000 before Namibian independence. Namibian and South African fleet catches showed a slow recovery from there on.&#160; <br/><br/>Resource management changed in 1977 with the declaration of a 200 mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for South Africa and its waters, as well as for Namibia in 1990 after its independence. A large part of the fishing effort corresponding to foreign fleets was removed.&#160; While foreign fleet fishing was reduced drastically, total allowable catches (TACs) were introduced, which helped the recovery of resources at the end of the 1990s. The main reason for the delay in the resources responding to a reduction in fishing mortality was a result of anoxic conditions in 1993 and 1994 which led to very poor recruitment in hake populations (Lloris <em>et al.</em> 2005).",The South African hake trawl fishery of this species has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council as well-managed and sustainable.,Unknown,"This species is abundant off the coast of Nambia and South Africa (Macpherson and Gordoa 1994).

This is purported to be the result of a recent offshore migration, but it could also indicate a trend towards an increasing mean age in population. Yet, in spite of the slight increase in deep water Cape Hake densities, the overall Cape Hake are well below figures of the previous survey. Plots of Cape Hake densities from fishing stations have shown a slight improvement of the distribution of the species, especially in the northern regions, but a """"serious drop in the biomass of the Southern region"""" (South Africa and Namibia) was confirmed with a 95% degree of confidence (Ona and Stromme 1996).<br/><br/> Until 1978, this species, together with <em>M. paradoxus</em>, yielded the largest hake catches in the world (i.e. 1,122,000 tonnes in 1972; FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012).

There is evidence to support that this species is over-exploited and that over-fishing is a major threat to the subpopulations. <br/><br/>The main fishing methods used catch this fish are trawls, fixed nets and seines. Bottom longline and set-net fisheries are targeting adults of this species in some areas (not in Turkish waters at present). Details of this fishing effort are only rarely available.<br/><br/>The European Hake is the most important demersal species in western European continental shelf fisheries (Casey and Pereiro 1995). For this reason it has been extensively studied, but some uncertainty still remains concerning both the population structure and the state of the stocks. Indeed, recent molecular studies have shown that the spatial pattern of hake subpopulations is more complex than previously thought, with possible roles for ecological and oceanographic factors in temporal variation of population genetic composition in the Bay of Biscay (Lundy <em>et al. </em>1999). Moreover, hake stocks are generally considered over-exploited (Alheit and Pitcher 1995). In 1955, over 160,000 tonnes were harvested; more recently, in 2000, approximately 60,000 tonnes were harvested, but in 2009 and 2010, nearly 100,000 tonnes were hauled in each year and sold on the market (FAO Fishery Statistics).

In addition, at least one locus revealed significantly  different genotype distributions (Lundy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>.  1999). These results suggest that migration between these fishing  grounds is restricted and therefore relevant to fisheries management.  However, until the temporal stability of this limited rate of migration  between stocks from the southern Bay of Biscay and the Celtic Sea can be  genetically demonstrated, caution should be taken in the management of  these areas (Lundy <em>et al</em>. 1999). Furthermore, high dispersive capabilities of a marine organism do not necessarily  translate into high levels of realized gene flow. Population structure  often does exist in such species (Palumbi 1994) and in these cases the evolutionary and ecological processes  responsible nearly always have direct relevance to any management plans  for exploited species involved (Avise 1998). By identifying genetically meaningful units, the management of  economically important marine species can be improved by targeting  individual units, or stocks with definable levels of recruitment and  mortality (Lundy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1999).</p>   <span class=""""sheader5"""">  <p></p>","<em>Merluccius merluccius</em> is a priority species for the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM).

As it overlaps in distribution with <em>M. polli</em> at intermediate depths, the two species are often caught together and the catch statistics are reported in combined form (Fernandez-Peralta&#160;<em>et al. </em>2011). This kind of non-differentiation in catch statistics could lead to the possible exploitation of one species over the other. This species is taken by bottom trawls in offshore grounds off Mauritania and Senegal together with two other hakes (<em>M. merluccius </em>and<em> M. polli</em>). Most common fishing techniques are """"demersal bottom trawling"""" and """"Hake trawling"""". <br/><br/>Senegalese Hake under 40 cm in length are caught by trawlers targeting this species, as well as by smaller longliners and gillnetters. It is also captured as a bycatch of fisheries targeting cephalopods and shrimp. The Eastern Central Atlantic (ECA) fishery began at the beginning of the 20th century, with sailing trawlers from southern Spanish coast exploiting north African fishing grounds. This fleet gradually became motorized, vessels become larger, and their fishing range extended further south (Mauritania and Senegal). By the end of the 1960s, Portuguese, Polish and USSR fleets, amongst others, were exploiting the resource, and they continued to do so, using large trawlers of up to 2,000 FRT, until the 1970s. After the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) declaration, and in 1986 with the fishing agreement between Morocco and the European Union, European fleets were gradually reduced in the Moroccan EEZ. By 2000 only local fleets exploited the area. Eastern Central Atlantic catches also include Benguela Hake (<em>M. polli</em>), owing to overlapping of fisheries and identification problems. Catches reported to FAO show a peak period between 1973 and 1977 with around 100,000 tonnes annually resulting from USSR-fleet activity and to a lesser extent, Spanish fleets.

Biomass estimates over the period 1998 to 2003 showed a decline: for all visible scampi, from 988 tonnes to 509 tonnes, and for extrapolations based on burrow openings, ~5,500 tonnes to 3,600 tonnes.<br/><br/>Although little information is available on population structure, preliminary genetic work suggests a high degree of heterogeneity, with up to four genetically distinct sub-populations.

In 2012 Annual Catch Limits were implemented (WPRFMC 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Guam</strong><strong><br/></strong>This species is among the most extensively&#160;harvested&#160;lethrinids from reef flats in Guam and elsewhere (Taylor 2010). In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. The relative contribution of<em> M. grandoculis&#160;</em>is currently unknown. Catch-per-unit-effort has declined consistently from the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010, CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing; however, CPUE in 2010 is half that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive. In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Green <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished, however, there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)</strong><strong><br/></strong>Lethrinids, which are caught using various methods, are the dominant catch in the CNMI, sometimes doubling or tripling the next most landed species.&#160;Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011. Commercial landings of Lethrinids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Bottomfish stocks are not experiencing overfishing although there are no species-specific stock assessments available (WPRFMC 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><strong><br/></strong>The modal age of all samples of&#160;<em>M. grandoculis</em>, which indicates full recruitment to the common gear configuration used in Great Barrier Reef line fisheries, was three years, which corresponds to 20% of the estimated maximum age of 15 years. This species and other relatively large-bodied lethrinidae exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions. Very few specimens older than five years were sampled in the Great Barrier Reef (Currey<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013). This species is a minor component of the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery in the Great Barrier Reef and is primarily taken by charter vessels rather than the commercial sector (Currey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Visual census among three mid-continental shelf reefs revealed significant temporal variation in the abundance of this species with counts being significantly higher in July than in September, February and May (Newman and Williams 2001).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Southeast Asia</strong><strong><br/></strong>In the Philippines, this species used to be locally abundant. However, it has been overexploited and now is not as common (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2015).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The Gulf striped bass populations are also characterized by low levels of natural reproduction. Despite stocking large numbers of fish from Atlantic-origin populations, Gulf native populations are likely to remain small and may decrease due continuing fishing pressure and habitat degradation (Dieterich and Fulford 2012, Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protection from predation for young fish (Rulifson and Laney 1999,&#160;Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006). Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><br/>The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system was modeled under changing climate conditions simulating future climates and future demand for water withdrawal for human consumption. Specific anticipated changes include lower minimum flows and decreased flow variability. These changes could decrease connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent (Gibson <em>et a</em>l. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Introgression<br/></strong>Historically unique microsatelite alleles in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system in Geogia and Florida were reduced in frequency by introgression of non-native alleles due to stocking (Wirgin <em>et al</em>. 2005). Possible results include altered genetic characteristics of the native stock which can cause a change in genetic differences among populations (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 2009), a change in genetic composition (Susnik <em>et al</em>. 2004), and breakdown of genetic adaptations (McGinnity <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>Declines in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (where introduced) is attributed primarily to toxic substances and to entertainment of young in water diversion structures (Hassler 1988). Habitat destruction affected populations in Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Albemarle Sound, resulting in drastic declines in mid-20th century (Hill<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1989). Excess harvest contributed the decline along the U.S. east coast in the late 1970s and early 1980s; hatchery production and restrictions on the harvest resulted in population increases in the Chesapeake Bay region by the early 1990s (Diamond 1990).","<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System:</strong><br/>Since the extirpation of the Gulf native&#160;population from most river drainages in the Gulf of Mexico in the mid-1960s, restoration of these populations has been a major focus of fisheries managers in the region. &#160;Atlantic-origin striped bass began to be stocked into many Gulf rivers and reservoirs throughout the 1960s, and continues to the present in some tributaries. &#160;Stocking programs for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were initiated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) for Lake Seminole in 1965, and Lake Blackshear (Flint River, Georgia) in 1967. &#160;The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (currently the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or FFWC) began releasing fingerlings of Atlantic origin into the Apalachicola River in 1976. &#160;Approximately 1.8 million Atlantic fry (&lt;15 mm) and 125,000 fingerlings or adults (25-750 mm TL) were stocked into the ACF from 1965 to 1976. &#160;Hybrid striped bass were also introduced into ACF reservoirs during the 1970s&#160;(Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>Starting in the 1980s, ACF fisheries managers began focusing on the conservation and restoration of the native striped bass population. Genetic description and cataloging was a major component of this effort. &#160;The first annual <em>Morone </em>workshop was in 1982, where biologists and fisheries managers from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) met to discuss management of native and hybrid striped bass in the ACF. &#160;Representatives of conservation agencies in each state and the regional director of the FWS entered into a cooperative agreement of Gulf striped bass restoration for the ACF in 1987. &#160;This agreement emphasized the restoration of a self-sustaining population of Gulf striped bass to the maximum extent possible. &#160;The ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee was also formed under this agreement. &#160;Representatives from Mississippi, Louisiana, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, New York University School of Medicine, Gulf Coast Research Lab (southern Mississippi), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became participants of the workshop series, and as of 2011 the ACF <em>Morone </em>workshop had met for 29 consecutive years (Long<em> et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The first striped bass management plan for the ACF was finalized in 1996 (revised in 2004) with a general goal of enhancing the native Gulf striped bass population within the river system. &#160;Project objectives included:<ul><li>determining hatchery production requirements and optimum stocking rates and sizes</li><li>monitoring broodfish collections and stocking success</li><li>monitoring the sport fishery</li><li>identifying, enhancing, or protecting thermal refuge habitat</li><li>establishing broodfish repositories outside of the ACF</li><li>and participating in public outreach</li></ul>The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's (GSMFC) Anadromous Fish Subcommittee created the """"Striped Bass Fishery Management Plan"""" for the Gulf of Mexico (this plan was revised in 2006) (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;The goals of this comprehensive plan were to:<ul><li>establish and maintain a self-sustaining Gulf race population and fishery in the Pearl River (Louisiana and Mississippi), Pascagoula River (Mississippi), Escambia/Conecuh River (Alabama and Florida), Choctawhatchee Riverr (Alabama and Florida), and ACF river system (Alabama, Florida, and Georgia)</li><li>maintain mixed-race fisheries in the Mobile-Alabama-Tombigbee (MAT) river system</li><li>maintain a striped bass recreational fishery in the lower Mississippi River</li><li>maintain Gulf race put-and-grow fisheries in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte rivers (Louisiana), Perdido River (Alabama and Florida), Blackwater and Yellow rivers (Florida), and the Ochlockonee River (Florida and Georgia)</li><li>maintain striped bass put-grow-take fisheries in the Wolf, Jourdan, Biloxi, and Tchoutacabouffa river and Old Fort Bayou (Mississippi)</li></ul>Benefits from stocking large numbers of Atlantic-origin striped bass have not been consistently sustained through time and have not resulted in the ability of the population to self-sustain at a desired level that is significantly larger than previously observed from natural reproduction alone. &#160;Due to ecological restraints and anthropogenic alterations to the riverine environment, feasible opportunities for restoration of Gulf native striped bass populations are limited in a degraded habitat. &#160;In addition, stocking of large numbers of hatchery fish has not prevented the loss of the pure """"Gulf race"""" striped bass population. &#160;The physical renovation of several thermal refuges in the Apalachicola and Flint rivers met the objectives (habitat restoration or enhancement) of the ACF plan. &#160;However, due to the dynamic nature of the ACF river system, these renovation efforts were small and short-lived (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fisheries managers from Florida and Alabama have committed to stocking only Gulf striped bass into Gulf of Mexico tributaries within their historic range. &#160;Managers in Mississippi and Louisiana have also expressed a desire to stock only Gulf striped bass, but with the realization that they cannot sacrifice their established striped bass fisheries when Gulf fingerlings are not available for stocking. &#160;Therefore, fish managers in Mississippi are developing a broodfish repository in Ross Barnett Reservoir (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><br/>There is also a current conservation plan in Mississippi to restore naturally-reproducing, Gulf native populations in the Pearl and Pascagoula River systems through a stock enhancement program; the program began in 1967 and remains active today. &#160;However, due to the lack of studies on factors that limit growth and survival of released striped bass in Mississippi waters, seasonal habitat availability in the habitat is relatively unknown. &#160;As in the ACF, probability for population restoration is low in the coastal waters of Mississippi without improvement of the current degraded habitat (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><br/>As of 2002, striped bass had been stocked into at least 68 reservoirs on 11 Texas river systems since the 1960s. &#160;This has been described as one of the largest freshwater striped bass stocking programs in the nation, despite the discontinuation of stocking in some reservoirs. &#160;Most stocking sources were from Atlantic-origin fisheries, but a small number of Gulf native striped bass have also been stocked into Texas waters. &#160;Several successful and popular fisheries have been established in stocked lakes, including Toledo Bend Reservoir (shared with Louisiana). &#160;Natural reproduction by striped bass has been documented in the Brazos River and Trinity River in Texas but these populations are not known to be self-sustaining, and recruitment of naturally spawned striped bass into the adult population has not yet been determined. &#160;Though the river-stocking program in Texas produced successful fisheries, the bay-stocking program did not. &#160;Only 64 striped bass were caught from 1983 to 2003 by fishery-independent sampling. &#160;Most striped bass catches from fisheries were a recorded as bycatch (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><br/>Stocking in Louisiana started in the 1960s when fry were introduced in Toledo Band Reservoir and D'Arbonne Reservoir, and expanded in 1972 to inlcude stocking of several coastal rivers and estuarine areas in tan attempt to establish anadromous/coastal populations. &#160; As relatively small number of Gulf native striped bass has been stocked into two lakes in recent years, but the remainder of stocking in Louisiana was sourced from the Atlantic-origin population. &#160;There was an unsuccessful effort to establish Gulf native brood stock sources in Louisiana. &#160;In the Toledo Bend Reservoir, a put-grow-and-take striped bass fishery has been established, but no significant riverine or coastal fisheries have developed in Louisiana (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:</strong><br/>The ADCNR/WFF striped bass stocking program in Alabama has been very important to the success of the fisheries in many of the reservoirs and tailwater areas of the MAT. &#160;It is likely that a limited striped bass fishery developed in coastal Alabama in 1992, but the fish produced were not preferred by anglers. &#160;The coastal stocking program in Alabama's Mobile River Delta (MRD) was discontinued in 1995, and that fishery has likely declined since that time. &#160;Substantial natural reproduction and recruitment into downstream populations has been documented in the upper Coosa River, which is assumed to mostly involve Atlantic-origin striped bass. &#160;Natural striped bass spawning also occurs in lower portions of the MAT, but it has not been determined if this involves Atlantic or Gulf race fish and whether it has resulted in recruitment. &#160;Natural reproduction alone (without stocking) has not yet been assessed to determine if it can sustain populations/fisheries in the MAT. &#160;Most striped bass populations throughout the MAT are a combination of Atlantic- and Gulf-origin fish except for portions of the Black Warrior River (upstream of Warrior Dam), which may primarily be populated by Gulf native striped bass (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Striped bass stocking began in 1961 when 307-461 mm sub-adults from the Chesapeake Bay were released into Lake Talquin. &#160;In the early 1970s, striped bass were introduced into small lakes and reservoirs of the Florida Peninsula in order to control shad populations and provided a supplemental fishery. &#160;Shad populations were successfully controlled, but fishery establishment failed. &#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass in the Escambia/Conecuh system is uncertain due to lack of data. &#160;Annual stocking in the Blackwater and Yellow rivers is likely maintaining its population. &#160;The striped bass population in the Choctawhatchee River is likely being maintained at a low level by recent stocking efforts. &#160;Since 1996, only Gulf native striped bass fingerlings have been stocked into Lake Talquin in an effort to establish a Gulf native broodstock source. &#160;There is a limited striped bass population and fishery in the Ochlockonee River that is likely supported by stock enhancement. &#160;There is no data available for the striped bass population in the Suwanee River and no substantial amount of striped bass have been stocked into the system; there is doubt whether this system has ever supported a reproducing population of striped bass. &#160; &#160;<br/>The status of the striped bass population in the smaller gulf Coast rivers of Florida is unknown due to lack of data. &#160;However, it was documented that approximately 1,000 Gulf native striped bass fingerlings were stocked adjacent to the St. Mark's River (St. Mark's National Wildlife Refuge impoundments) in 1984. &#160;There are also occasional reported recreational catches from the St. Mark's River (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>Morone saxatilis</em> (Gulf native population)<em>&#160;</em>is likely to be managed by many other government agencies and programs. Harvest restrictions for striped bass have been enacted by each of the Gulf States for coastal waters and rivers (Fruge<em> et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>There are commercial and recreational limits for&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Morone saxatilis</span>&#160;that are managed by state jurisdictions (Maryland Department of Natural Resources 2012, Virginia Marine Resources Commission 2012).",Unknown,"<strong>Gulf of Mexico [[<span style="""""""">[supplementary document: excel sheet]]]</span></strong><p>Although striped bass is an anadromous species, populations at the northern and southern extremes of the range are generally potamodromous, migrating within freshwater systems and thus being riverine or estuarine in nature. &#160;It is likely that striped bass populations within tributaries of the Gulf of Mexico were endemic to individual rivers (Barkuloo 1967, McIlwain 1980). </p>  <p>Within the Gulf, the historical range of <em>M. saxatilis</em> from the Suwannee River (Florida), westward to the rivers of the Lake Pontchartrain basin in Louisiana. By the 1970s this species had been extirpated from all Gulf rivers except for small remnant populations in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system in Florida, Alabama and Georgia (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).The decline of striped bass was attributed to dam construction, water-quality degradation, and other anthropogenic impacts (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>&#160;To supplement the depleted Gulf population of striped bass, genetically distinct fry and fingerlings from Atlantic populations and hybrids (<em>M. chrysops</em> X striped bass) were released into the ACF between 1965 and 1976. In the 1980s interest in the conservation and restoration of the native Gulf striped bass led to stocking of only putative Gulf striped bass. </p>  <p>The restoration program is supported by genetic studies which show that a high percentage of ACF fish are genetically distinct from Atlantic populations (Wirgin 1990, 1991 1993, 1997), (Wirgin and Maceda 1991). The ACF population is now considered a different “race” from those in Atlantic rivers (Frugé&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><em>&#160;</em>2006), and any striped bass originating from the ACF system is considered a Gulf striped bass (Long et al. 2012). The ACF population is the only population of Gulf striped bass which supports continued natural reproduction (Wirgin<span class=""""apple-converted-space"""">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

species is also important to the aquaculture industry in Tabasco and Vera Cruz (M. Vega-Cendejas pers. comm. 2014). Robins and Ray (1986) report this species as the most important commercial mullet in the eastern United States. There is no evidence of overfishing in the 2010 Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute report and there is 35% SPR target. Mexico is one of the top ten productive countries of mullet in the world, with a mean annual production of approximately 12,000 tonnes/year, and a very valuable source of roe (Ibáñez 2012).&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU""""></span><span lang=""""EN-AU""""><span lang=""""EN-AU"""">Subpopulations of&#160;&#160;are sensitive to human activities and are probably experiencing decline in the southwestern Indian Ocean due to fishery exploitation and dam construction in streams (Fricke. 2009).&#160;Besides overexploitation, this species is also threatened by river modifications where it ranges off Cuba (Claro 2009).&#160;</span><em>M. cephalus</em><em>&#160;et al</em><em> et al.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","In the Gulf of&#160;Mexico, the Mexican&#160;fishery is regulated by the NOM -016 -PESC -1994 (DOF 24/04/95).

They are targeted by fishers via gill net during these migrations&#160;because of the high value of the gonad (roe). It reaches age at first maturity at three years and&#160;an average size of 30 cm, and is exploited at this age in Laguna Madre.&#160;Over&#160;the past 12 years, catch in&#160;Laguna Madre&#160;has remained on average 3,500 tonnes.&#160;In Tamiahua Lagoon, catch has declined by&#160;70%&#160;since the 1960s and 70s. The maximum sustainable yield for  in Laguna Madre in the year 2000 was estimated at 3,017 tonnes. Over the years, catch has had a cyclic manner with ebbs and flows between 3,000 and approximately 5,000 tonnes, with declines in catch corresponding to the years when MSY was exceeded. Off Tamaulipas, both  and  are considered fully exploited. Off Veracruz, has experienced a 70% decline in catch since the year 2000 (SAGARPA 2012). Catch of mullets off&#160;Cuba&#160;have declined markedly due to overfishing of spawning aggregations and migrations (Claro 2009).&#160;There is no evidence of overfishing in the 2010 Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute report and there is 35% SPR target. This species was among the top ten most abundant species collected from the lower mouth of the Peace River in Florida. Specimens were collected using 21.3 m seines in from April 1997 to May 1999 and July 2007 to April 2010 (Stevens 2013). Mullet were among the ten dominant species collected from tidal streams throughout the coast of Texas (Tolan and Nelson 2013). It is also one of the most abundant species collected with bag seines in every bay system in Texas (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014, Texas Parks and Wildlife database). Its estimated area of occupancy (AOO) in the Gulf of Mexico is 155,503 km (calculated by clipping the distribution polygon to the zero to 20 m bathymetric layer extracted from ETOPO) with 11,566 km of that represented by the areas of overexploitation(combined Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Cuba).&#160;Therefore, it is inferred that the proportion of its population in the Gulf of Mexico that has experienced significant declines is likely to be less than half of the overall population.&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Overfishing may present a threat to some subpopulations of this species as important subsistence fishing and small-scale fisheries.&#160;<em>Mugil curema</em>&#160;is an important species in many artisanal fisheries, particularly in the southern part of its range (Thomson 1978, Harrison 1995, Garibaldi 1996).&#160;In Florida, white mullet are not prized as food, but are valuable as bait in the billfish sportfishery (Collins 1985)..&#160;It is also threatened by river modifications where it ranges off Cuba (Claro<em> et al</em>. 2009). The species is dependent on estuaries for spawning and as juvenile habitat. Modification of coastal areas, loss of mangroves and degradation of estuaries is a significant localized threat to this species.","<p>Ordenance nº08/03-N, from 20/March/2003 established a minimum catch size of 40 cm along the south and southern Brazilian coast. The mullet gillnet fishery is also regulated by a IBAMA law enacted March 15, 2011, which established the minimum mesh size of 70 mm. Off Mexico, this fishery is regulated by the NOM -016 -PESC -1994 (DOF 24/04/95). There are annual seasonal closures in coastal waters of northern Tamaulipas and Veracruz, from the Tuxpan River and Lake Tampamachoco to the Rio Panuco between 1 to 31 December and from 1 to 28 February. The minimum catch size is 26 cm&#160;and the minimum mesh size is 76 mm (three inches).&#160;It is recommended to not increase the current fishing effort in terms of fishing permits involving <em>M. cephalus</em> and <em>M. curema</em>. For&#160;<em>M. cephalus</em> in the Laguna Madre it is recommended that the level of exploitation should not exceed 3,000 tonnes per year, another seasonal closure should be considered for the months of September and October, recovery strategies&#160;should be designed for analyses and evaluations in each annual fishing season, mainly for the state of Veracruz which utilizes both <em>M. cephalus</em> and <em>M. curema</em>, It is also recommended a management plan be developed for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico&#160;(SAGARPA 2012).</p>  <p> </p>",Unknown,"<p><span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Mugil curema</span>&#160;is a commercially important species throughout its range (Marin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160;</p><p><strong>United States:</strong> The wholesale landing value for white mullet in the Gulf Coast States (US) from 1994-1998 was reported to be 38.2 million dollars. It also supports a substantial recreational fishery. In Florida, this species is part of the silver mullet fishery which includes white mullet (<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Mugil curema</span>), redeye mullet (<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">M. gaimardianus</span>), and fantail mullet (<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">M. gyrans</span>). White mullet is the most common as a baitfish for sport fishery and for commercial use. Data from Florida between 1982 to 1995 showed a doubling of commercial landings on the Atlantic coast of Florida, but a decline in landings on the Gulf coast. Recreational landings vary during that time period, but were greater on the Atlantic than Gulf coast. The most recent stock assessment for the silver mullet complex (Mahmoudi 2002) suggest that the increased landings on the Atlantic coast could be cause for concern. However, at the time of the assessment, landing and fishing effort appeared to have stabilized on the Atlantic coast, and fishing mortality was not above Fmsy. The Gulf coast silver mullet fishery was considered healthy and no sign of growth or recruitment overfishing was observed (Mahmoudi 2002). It&#160;is<em>&#160;</em>absent from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico during the winter (McEachran and Fechhelm 1998); they are most abundant in this area during the summer (Modde and Ross 1981, Ditty and Shaw 1996).</p><p><strong>Mexico: </strong>A study from the white mullet fishery on the Mexican Pacific coast suggests that this species may be overexploited in the Colima region (Cabral-Solis&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). Off Mexico, this species conducts massive spawning migrations from February to March, moving in shoals from lagoons to the sea. They are targeted by fishers via gill net during these migrations&#160;because of the high value of the gonad (roe). Since 2003, catch of <em>M. curema</em> has declined by 46% (SAGARPA 2012). Management benchmarks for <em>M. curema</em> are not defined for Veracruz, but it is recommended that catch not exceed 4,665 t per year. Off Tamaulipas, both <em>M. cephalus</em> and <em>M. curema</em> are considered fully exploited. Off Veracruz, <em>M. cephalus</em> has experienced a 70% decline in catch since the year 2000 (SAGARPA 2012). Catch of mullets off Cuba have declined markedly due to overfishing of spawning aggregations and migrations (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Gulf of Mexico is considered one of the more heavily populated areas for&#160;<em>M. curema&#160;</em>(Nirchio<em> et al</em>. 2005).<em>&#160;</em>It has been described as abundant in the coastal lagoons of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (Bonilla-Gómez <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em>&#160;&#160;</em>This species is considered to be one of the top five exploited fishes from the Alvarado coastal lagoon in Mexico (FAO 1979).</p><p><strong>Venezuela: </strong>It is described as an important artisanal fishery resource in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela (Montano 1994).&#160;</p><p><strong>Brazil:</strong> In Brazil this species is frequent, abundant and widely distributed along the coast.

In northern Brazil, it was the second most caught species in the Paciência River estuary, Maranhao State (Castro 2001). It was also dominant in the estuary of the Curuçá River (Giarrizo and Krumme 2007), with registered biomass of up to 3172 g ha–1. In Marajó Bay, this species is abundant during the dry season (Barthem 1985). In northeastern Brazil, this species is the most abundant mugilid species, accounting for 96% of the catch of all mullets in the region. It is captured by gillnets in northern Pernambuco State all over the year, in coastal and estuarine areas. Individuals are recruited for fishery at 1.5 years old in the estuary and 3.4 years old on the coast. In estuaries, 81.6% of individuals caught are juveniles and the modal age class is one year (but individuals of 0.4 to 9.8 years are caught). On the coast, 86.7% are adults, from 1.6 to 14.2 years old, with a modal age class of age of three years. The high catch of juveniles in the estuary and the low fecundity rate might affect the maintenance of the species under fishing pressure (Silva 2007). In Southern Brazil, there is an intense artisanal fishery for this species in Cananeia, Iguape and Ilha Comprida estuarine systems. The species is one of the most common fishery resources, typically harvested by gillnet and fish traps. An analysis of production data, fishing effort and CPUE suggest that the resource is overfished in this area due to a progressive increase in fishing effort (Mendonca and Bonfante 2011).&#160;</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The area between Rio de Janeiro to Golfo Nuevo, where the significant Brazil-Argentinian fisheries are located, comprises approximately 12% of its total range. Since the year 2000, directed effort has increased due to expanding industrial purse seines fleets, especially in 2008 when the species was raised to the fifth position among the most captured species in Brazil. The development of a new market for fish roe has made this species a main target over the past decade. In addition, the sardine purse seiners have been displaced due to the decline in sardine populations and switched to targeting mullet (Garbin et al. 2014). This threat will likely continue unless management measures are implemented. It is targeted during its spawning period, which considerably impacts populations along Brazil (Miranda and Carneiro 2007). In the Patos Lagoon, the artisanal fishery frequently uses forbidden mesh-size gillnets to capture <em>Mugil liza </em>both within and out of designated fishing seasons, resulting in fishing pressures on individuals that have not reached sexual maturity. Similarly, current mesh-size regulations do not exclude sexual immature individuals (Ceni et al. 2016). In addition to fishing threats, the construction of a dam built in 1977 in the channel that connected Patos and Mirim Lagoon systems is degrading the salinity level and preventing juveniles from reaching Mirim Lagoon (Burns et al. 2006). Threats by habitat loss or pollution also occur as many coastal and estuarine areas are degraded and polluted along its range, particularly in the proximity of large cities. The Mundau Lagoon, in Maceio city, capital of Alagoas State is one of such examples (Fabre pers. comm. 2011). It is known to be threatened by river modifications where it ranges off Cuba (Claro et al. 2009). Successful recruitment is seriously impacted during El Nino years due to excessive freshwater runoff into estuaries (Vieira et al. 2008).</p>","<p>Ordenance nº08/03-N, from 20/March/2003 established a minimum catch size of 40 cm in southern Brazil. Normative Instruction nº 171 from IBAMA (09/May/2008) regulated mullet fisheries by establishing a closed period for fishing between 01 Jan to 14 May in all estuarine-lagoon systems along the south and southern Brazilian coast. It also limited the fishing effort of paired-trawlers to 60 vessels, established a closed period for fishing between 01 May to 30 July along the Santa Catarina coast to less than one nautical mile from the beaches licensed for beach-seine fishery using canoe and less than 300 m from rocky coasts. Normative Instruction nº3 from MMA/SEAP, de 09/02/2004, established a  closed period for fishing between 01 July to 31 September in Lagoa dos  Patos (RS). The Brazilian Inter-ministerial Instruction (MPA/MMA No. 7 of 2011) banned the landing of <em>M. liza</em> roe without their respective carcasses (Lemos <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;There is an urgent need for a formal management plan, monitoring of landings, and standardization of catch statistics by effort. Establishing a closed season from May to August and requiring a minimum catch size of 35 cm TL would enhance population conservation (Albieri and Araujo 2010). There are no species-specific conservation measures in place<em>&#160;</em>within the Gulf of Mexico.&#160;</p>",Unknown,"<p><strong>Brazil and Argentina:</strong> Population information is mainly available for the southern portion of the species' distribution (southern Brazil and Argentina) which represent the species highest area of abundance. Ripe fish have been targeted during their spawning migration for over a century by artisanal fisheries in southern Brazil, and industrial purse seine fisheries began in the early 2000s. In addition, 95% of the commercial catch is collected from south Brazil between São Paulo and Argentina with 95% of that catch (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina combined) being landed in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina (Lemos et al. 2014). Employed gears and methods have evolved but artisanal fisheries has remained mainly coastal, and the resource has a great social and economic importance for coastal populations, as well as a guarantee of food security for riverine and coastal communities. This species is targeted in gillnet artisanal fisheries in Porto das Pedras, northern Alagoas State (Torres et al. 2007). It is caught by artisanal fishery in Itaipu, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro State (Monteiro-Neto et al. 2008) and beach seine fisheries in Sao Vicente Island, Sao Paulo State (Fagundes et al. 2007). It is fished by artisanal fleets on the south coast of Parana State (Chaves and Robert 2001). It is a very important resource in Patos Lagoon (Reis and D’Incao 2000, Okamoto et al. 2006, Vieira et al. 2008) and Peixes Lagoon, Rio Grande do Sul State (where it represented 76.4% of&#160; total catches, according to Loebmann and Vieira (2005). It is also and economically and culturally important species on Santa Catarina coast (Medeiros 2002). It is an important species for both artisanal and industrial fisheries along the coast of Sao Paulo. The artisanal fishery in Sao Paulo State is not considered a threat, as the landings from this fishery are much smaller than the industrial fleet (Abeu-Mota et al. 2018). Industrial fishery in Brazil operates from Rio Grande do Sul to Rio de Janeiro. This fleet has always caught M. liza as an alternative target, but in 2000 the species became a main target for industrial fisheries, when the industrial purse-seine fleet directed efforts to this species, after the collapse of the sardine and implementation of regulatory measures for the sardine fishery. Industrial fishing activity is typically most intense in May at Rio Grande do Sol, June and July at Santa Catarina and Parana, and in late June and early July at Sao Paulo, with northward progression of fleet activity from the beginning to the end of the fishing season (Lemos et al. 2016). A recent stock estimate of the southern subpopulation estimates total mortality rate (Z) at 0.77 year<sup>-1</sup> and the exploitation rate (u) at greater than 0.5 (Garbin et al. 2014). Production of this species is highly variable among the years, being greatly dependent on environmental conditions (Seckendorff and Azevedo 2007). It is of high economic and cultural importance in Sanboronbom Bay, Argentina and in the south/southeastern coast of Brazil. Adults are exploited by both artisanal fleets (Argentina) and industrial fleets (Brazil) during its fall spawning migration and subsequent aggregation, which may be a main reason for the decrease in its abundance. It was classified as overexploited by the Brazil Ministry of Fishing and Aquaculture in 2004 and some workers fear a fisheries collapse could occur (Lemos et al. 2014). Landings from the artisanal fleet operating in Patos Lagoon (Brazil) from 1945 to 2010 show a steady decline from 3,588 tonnes in the early 70s to 266 tonnes in 2004, a reduction of 92 %. Similarly, the artisanal community at Santa Catarina State reports a reduction in catch (Machado-Martins et al. 2018). These landings are not standardized by effort. However, effort is thought to have increased over the time period examined. Due to strong yearly fluctuations, the trend was re-calculated plotting catch per year between 1970 and 2004 and the decline was estimated from the obtained linear trend (rsq 0.52). Using this method, a 90% decline was estimated. Although weaknesses in fisheries statistics due to changes in methods and monitoring agencies may have introduced bias and errors, it is believed that this trend does indicate a strong population decline in Patos Lagoon (Vieira et al. 2008). &#160;Additionally, current catch mostly consists of individuals near age at first maturity and the overall average individual size has significantly decreased, which is an indication of growth overfishing (M. Brick Peres pers. comm. 2011). Recruitment in Patos Lagoon, an important nursery site, remained constant between 1979-2011 (J. P. Vieira unpub. data), which may indicate that spawning stocks are still available. However, the LTER program which has been sampling Patos since 1978, has detected significant declines in juvenile abundance over the past five years (J. Vieira pers. comm. 2015). The recent expansion of fishing grounds with the discovery of new stocks sustain this hypothesis. Along the coast of Sao Paulo State, landings for Mugil liza have fluctuated between 330 t in 1990 and 411 t in 2010, to peaks of 613 t in 2004 and 783 t in 2008 (Instituto de Pesca - SAA/SP unpublished data). In southern Sao Paulo, the fishery for this species is mainly artisanal with fishers using weirs and gill nets in estuarine areas and gillnets and trawls in the coastal zone (Mendonça and Katsuragawa 2001, Clauzet et al. 2005, Miranda and Carneiro 2007). The fishery employs approximately 600 artisanal fishermen in this region. Landings averaged 200 t/year from 2003 onward, with peak catch occurring in the winter months (Miranda and Carneiro 2007, Seckendorf and Azevedo 2007, Mendonça 2007, Mendonça et al. 2011). The peak catches were observed in March and September in the coastal fishery and in June and July for the estuarine fishery. An increase in CPUE from the artisanal estuarine gill net fishery occurred until 2004 (Mendonça 2007), followed by a reduction of 41% between 2004 to 2010 (Instituto de Pesca - SAA/SP, unpublished data). The decrease in CPUE has not been accompanied by a reduction in the average length of individuals caught by this artisanal fishery (Miranda and Carneiro 2007). Landings of the industrial fishery around the port of Santos also show fluctuations, with peaks of 410 t and 483 t in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The annual landings from the industrial fleet represent at least 88% of the total landings of the area. According to Fagundes et al. (2007), the species is frequently captured by beach trawls around Sao Vicente Island in the months of July, August, December and April. In the northern part of Sao Paulo State, the species is targeted mainly by an artisanal fishery, although landings are sometimes reported from industrial vessels when they occur in the municipality of Ubatuba. The landings averaged 40 t between 2008 and 2010, and employ around 350 fishers in the area. Targeting of spawning aggregations by the industrial fishery in Brazil raises potential concerns that this stock is exhibiting hyperstability, warranting careful consideration of this bias in future stock assessment (Sant’Ana et al. 2017). </p><p><strong>Gulf of Mexico:</strong> In the Gulf of Mexico, <em>Mugil liza</em> is often caught with <em>Mugil cephalus</em> in Mexico; species-specific information is lacking and the population trend is unknown (H. Espinosa Perez and M. Vega-Cendejas pers. comm. 2014). Catch of mullets off Cuba have declined markedly due to overfishing of spawning aggregations and migrations (Claro et al. 2009).</p><p>    <strong>Population connectivity:</strong> Morphological variations have been observed associated with latitudinal variations (Cousseau et al. 2005, Menezes et al. 2010). Siccha-Ramirez et al. (2014) reported that there is one single population of this species across the southern Caribbean to South America. However, Mai et al. (2014) reports evidence for separation between subpopulations from samples taken at Niteroi (Brazil), Ubatuba and Laguna e Rio Grande (Brazil), and Argentina, with a distinct subpopulation occurring southward from Rio de Janiero to Argentina. Similarly, Callico-Fortunato et al. (2017) recognizes a single stock south of Rio de Janiero. Occurrence of a distinct spawning aggregation in the south of Santa Catarina State, Brazil (Vieira and Scalabrin 2001) and mature individuals in Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro State (Albieri and Araujo 2010) followed by recruitment in the same area (Silva and Araujo 2000) suggest that there are two or more spawning areas along the species distribution. If subpopulations distinguishable both genetically and biologically occur along the southwestern Atlantic coast, it is important that management and conservation measures take this into consideration.</p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_unknown_status

It is sometimes quite abundant in these catches from November to March (Cudney and Turk 1998). In this region it is less commonly caught in bottom gill-nets.

Specific management regulations have been lacking, but the recent development of a shark plan for Ecuador and recently introduced measures should lead to improvements (Fowler 2005). In Ecuador, Decree 2130 banned target fisheries and fin trade in 2004, but implementation and enforcement was insufficient and fins continued to be exported illegally. The export of fins is not banned in Peru. Subsequently, Decree 486 permitted trade in fins from bycatch, mandated the full utilisation of all shark meat, and required monitoring of all bycatch and a licensing system for the trade of fins. This decree provided an important means of monitoring shark catches.",Unknown,"No decline in catches or subpopulations has been observed in any region for this shark.

In winter, the species is fished in south Brazil as a component of a mixed-species fishery and also by directed fishing. Bottom trawl fishery CPUE in south Brazil are evidence that since intensive fishing has occurred from 1985 onwards, the abundance of the winter migrant population of the species had decreased by 85% by 1997, and the fishery continues without restraint (Miranda and Vooren 2003). In south Brazil a small local population reproduced in spring, and remained during the summer. Neonates used to be commonly caught by beach seine and bottom trawl in the 1980s. In a recent summer shore fishery survey (2003) the species was not recorded. This population seems to have disappeared and this is attributed to fishing in its inshore pupping and nursery areas (Vooren and Lamónaca unpublished data). <br/> <br/>In Argentina, this species has been an important fishery resource since 1988 (Chiaramonte 1998) and market demands have increased over the last eight years. Intensive fishing in coastal nursery areas threatens recruitment while fishing for adults is increasing. In the main fishing area off Buenos Aires Province (Argentina) and Uruguay (the Bonaerensean region), biomass has decreased by 22%, while national landings in Argentina decreased by 30% between 1998 and 2002 (Massa and Hozbor unpublished data). Fisheries statistics may underestimate the actual volume landed, however reductions in landings are an indication that the resource cannot withstand the current level of exploitation. The most recent data (2003) indicate a continuing decline in the stock. This area appears to have the greatest abundance of the species. <br/> <br/>In industrial and artisanal fisheries in Uruguay this species is not targeted but taken as bycatch. Together with <em>M. fasciatus</em>, estimated capture for the period 2000-2002 was 900t per year (<em>M. schmitti</em> was the main species taken).","There are no conservation measures at present for the species, except the Maximum Permitted Catch (MPC) established by the Argentine fisheries authorities. Although the MPC was reduced annually for the last four years, landings of <em>M. schmitti</em> have continued to decline. Understanding the migrations of the populations of the species is necessary for conservation. The migratory populations should be conserved through international management of the fishery involving Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The local population in south Brazil (if it still remains) should be conserved through marine protected areas in the shallow coastal zone. Marine protected areas in nursery areas throughout its range are necessary to protect breeding females and juveniles.",Decreasing,"Pupping occurs inshore in spring throughout the range from south Brazil to Patagonia, and body size of the adults increases with latitude in Argentina (Cousseau 1982, 1986, Chiaramonte and Pettovello 1998, Vooren and Lamónaca unpublished data, Domingo unpublished data). This is evidence of the existence of several populations of the species. One large population migrates to south Brazil in autumn and leaves that area in spring, presumably in a southward migration with unknown route. A locally breeding smaller population existed in south Brazil but may have been extirpated by the fishery. Important nursery areas exist in Argentina off Buenos Aires Province in Cabo San Antonioand El Rincón (Cousseau 1986). Another two nursery areas probably of lesser importance occur in north (Bahía Engaño, 43°20´S) and south (Puerto Deseado, 48°S) Patagonia (Van der Molen <em>et al</em>. 1998, Chiaramonte and Pettovello 2000).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

It is protected within the Conch Reef Research Only Area (a no-take marine reserve) in the northern Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (Lindholm <em>et al.</em> 2005). <br/><br/>Since 1990 in Bermuda, fish pots have been banned and bag limits, minimum legal size limits and seasonal area closures have been implemented. However, the effectiveness of these measures is unclear due to the lack of sufficient data on the status of fish stocks (Kura<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004 in Trott and Luckhurst 2007).<br/> <br/>In Mexico, an annual month-long seasonal closure of the grouper fishery has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003), and this is now being extended to two months (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, 2003a,b; Caballero-Arango 2013; Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015; SAGARPA 2016). The Mexican grouper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean also includes limiting commercial fishing permits, hook size limits and a minimum size limit (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). There is also a quota in place for the Cuban fleet that fishes Campeche Bank (Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al.</em> 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). It is recommended that no-take protective measures for grouper spawning aggregations at Alacranes Reef be implemented.&#160;No clear data on the effectiveness of seasonal closures are available and it is not known how this and other efforts to reduce fishing effort are enforced. It has been recommended that current fishing effort be reduced to levels in the 1980s, and to also reduce fishing mortality by 20% within five years and improve species-specific fishery data collection&#160;(SAGARPA 2012, 2014a).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>In the Gulf of Mexico, Zatcoff (2001) and Zatcoff <em>et al</em>.

Based on genetic studies, the U.S. stock is managed as a single unit across the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Its U.S. population is centered in south Florida and the Florida Keys and the majority of catch occurs there as well. A stock assessment of the U.S. stock concluded that this species is not overfished and not undergoing overfishing (SEDAR19 2010). Total biomass in the U.S. stock was stable at 6 million pounds from 1986 to 1993 and increased thereafter to 11 million pounds in 2008. Spawning biomass showed a similar pattern, where it was stable at 3.5 million pounds until 1993 when it began to increase to 8.3 million pounds in 2008 (SEDAR19 2010). According to SEDAR48 (2017), uncertainty related to potential confusion between <em>M. bonaci</em> and <em>M. microlepis</em> in landings data has caused a delay in an updated stock assessment for this species, and there are substantial concerns that this issue affects catch data collected since 1986.

Quantitative data past the year 2008 are very limited for northeast Brazil, but it is suspected that the dramatic declines since the 1980s have continued to the present. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the depleted phase was 1.4 kg/fisher/day (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2003), which was considerably lower than in the late 1970s at 12 kg/day/fisher. More recent landings in Caravelas (Abrolhos region) were comprised mostly of immature individuals (78% of the catch) (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2011). In northeastern Brazil (Ceara to Alagoas), statistics available from Estatpesca from 1993 to 2005 indicated that monthly catches of <em>Mycteroperca </em>species fluctuated with peaks during summer (Teixeira <em>et al.</em> 2004), but the collection of landings statistics was interrupted in 2008.

Ferreira <em>et al</em>.

Fisheries operating in the Brazilian oceanic islands, including the Trindade and Martin Vaz insular complex and the Vitoria–Trindade submarine chain, have also heavily exploited this species since at least the 1990s (Martins<em> et al. </em>2005, Pinheiro<em> et al.</em> 2010b, Pinheiro<em> et al. </em>2011).<em><br/></em>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

It is particularly susceptible to overfishing due to certain intrinsic life history characteristics that include protogyny, slow growth, late age at maturity and&#160;aggregating behaviour (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998, Huntsman <em>et al</em>. 1999). Due to their predictability in space and time, spawning aggregations are easily accessed and repeatedly fished (McGovern <em>et al</em>. 1998). It is easily captured year-round due to advanced GPS positioning of fishing gear over reef aggregations. It also suffers high rates of mortality from the effects of barotrauma. The dramatic decline in the proportion of males in spawning aggregations is of concern regarding sperm limitation, disruption of sex change processes and inbreeding (Coleman<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1996,&#160;Chapman<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1999,&#160;Koenig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Koenig and Coleman 2011). Other threats include juvenile seagrass/estuarine habitat degradation due to pollution, coastal development and extreme red tide events (Renán <em>et al</em>. 2004, Koenig and Coleman 2012, Nelson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Extensive <em>Oculina </em>habitat destruction in the Oculina Banks, primarily due to illegal shrimp trawling, drastically reduced the quality of this area for reef fish habitat and spawning (Koenig <em>et al.</em> 2005, Reed <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although the <em>Oculina</em> coral habitat has been destroyed in over 90% of the reserve (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2007), this species may still spawn there.","<strong>Mexico: </strong>A seasonal closure of the grouper fishery from February 15 to March 15 has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure was extended from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Other regulations for the Mexican grouper fishery include limited number of commercial permits, use of circle hook types and minimum size limits (SAGARPA 2009, 2014a). It has been recommended to reduce fishing effort to levels in the 1980s (estimated at 320 vessels carrying an average of six trips a year for each fishing unit and with a duration of 15 days per trip) and reduce grouper fishing mortality by 20% within five years and conduct further species-specific research (SAGARPA 2012, 2014b). The level of effective enforcement of these regulations is not known.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>United States:&#160;</strong>In 1990, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council adopted a 20-inch minimum size, five-fish grouper bag limit for recreational fishers, and a commercial shallow-water quota of 9.8 million pounds (Schirripa and Goodyear 1994). In 2000, commercial and recreational minimum size limits were increased to 24 and 22 inches, sales of this species were prohibited from 15 February to 15 March and two marine reserves (Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps)&#160;were established where fishing for reef fishes was prohibited year-round (Turner <em>et al.</em> 2001; http://www.gulfcouncil.org/oldstories/2002-03-26-Gag%20Status%20Change%20Requested.htm accessed February 2006). Further measures have been implemented in both reserves since then. The Madison Swanson Fishery Reserve, which is on the shelf edge of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, includes about 20 spawning aggregation sites of this species (Koenig and Coleman 2011).&#160;In Florida, the fishing season is restricted to 1 June to 31 December in Gulf waters and from 1 May to 31 December for Atlantic waters, and certain areas are closed to bottom fishing year-round (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2016). According to Boyan (2000), less than 2% of reported commercial catches occurred in the closed area, enforcement was insufficient to prevent illegal fishing, one-month closures failed to significantly reduce commercial landings since spawning aggregations continue for three months and the 24 inch size limit only reduced recreational and commercial take by 30-36% and 16%, respectively. Current regulations include a limited entry fishery where a limited number of commercial fishing permits is available, a seasonal closure during March and April to reduce the commercial catch and minimum size limits, quota with size limits for both commercial and recreational fisheries, bag limits for recreational fisheries, and limited gear restrictions (including elimination of traps, restricted areas for use of long-line gear required use of circle hooks for the hook and line fishery) (Koenig and Coleman 2012).&#160;The spawning site in the Oculina Banks is now part of a marine reserve established by the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council where fishing is prohibited year-round.&#160;Shelf-edge fishery reserves are necessary to manage the fishery for this species and ensure optimum reproductive capacity (Koenig <em>et al. </em>2000).<strong>&#160;</strong>Specimens collected inside the Madison-Swanson Reserve are older and larger with a lower female-biased sex ratio over those captured outside. Commercial fishing effort is relatively high in the areas surrounding the reserve, and there are direct indications that a spillover effect is occurring (Koenig and Coleman 2011).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil: </strong>There is a minimum harvest size for this species in Brazilian waters (IBAMA 2003).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Research needed: </strong>Further research is needed on the behaviour, genetics and physiology of sex reversal, maturation and migration, timing and control of sex reversal, formation and nature of shallow pre-spawning aggregations, and movement of fish to and from spawning sites (Koenig and Coleman 2012). In addition, the geographic coverage of juvenile abundance indices should be expanded to evaluate recruitment success and predict trends in adult population size and to increase the accuracy of maps of juvenile habitat. More large (greater than 100 miles<sup>2</sup>) year-round closures of shelf-edge areas that encompass spawning sites of this species are needed to protect the male component of the population (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Considering fishers have generally not been able to meet the U.S. quota recently, may suggest that the quota is too high to be of conservation use.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is, or was, a naturally fairly common species on hard-bottom and rocky ledges throughout its range. Its global population is comprised of two widely-separated subpopulations: one in the U.S. South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and the other in southern Brazil. Tagging studies have shown extensive migrations of adults from South Carolina reefs to shelf-edge reefs of northwest Florida in the Gulf of Mexico (McGovern <em>et al.</em> 2005). Molecular studies also indicate that U.S. South Atlantic and eastern Gulf of Mexico stocks are connected (Cushman<em> et al</em>. 2009). Larval dispersal occurs across the entire West Florida Shelf and genetic evidence indicate there is some level of connectivity between populations on the Campeche Bank and the West Florida Shelf (Jue 2010, Jue<em> et al</em>. 2015). Genetics substructure in the Campeche Bank stock may act as a source for a mixed population on the West Florida Shelf (Renán<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>According to various types of fisheries data, including landings, catch per unit effort (CPUE), modelled total and spawning stock biomass, and anecdotal reports from fishers, this species is estimated to have declined on a global-level by an average of 30-60% since the 1980s, or over the past two generation lengths (about 34 years). Due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next generation length (17 years). Other evidence that supports the occurrence of serious declines includes the reduction and/or extirpation of spawning aggregations, highly female-skewed sex ratios, frequent take of juveniles (e.g., Mexico) and declines in body size and age at first maturity (see following discussion).</p><strong>U.S. Gulf of Mexico: </strong>This species is most abundant in the northeast Gulf of Mexico off Florida and is the second most common grouper taken in commercial fisheries in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico besides <em>Epinephelus morio</em> (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Abundance of this species on shallow artificial reefs off Cedar Key, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico declined significantly between 2001-2008, regardless of habitat quality (Lindberg<em> et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Data collected from commercial fisheries on the Madison Ridge in the Gulf of Mexico, which is a historically important area for spawning aggregations of this species, reported severe declines in catch, extirpations of most aggregations and severely truncated age distributions prior to closure of Madison Swanson Reserve to fishing in 2000. After closure of the reserve, size and age of this and other species increased and spawning aggregations have been repopulated (Koenig and Coleman 2006 and 2011, SEDAR33 2014). The proportion of males was 1-2% higher inside the Madison Swanson Reserve after fishing was restricted in that area (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Although the commercial fishery catches larger fish (on average) than the recreational fishery, the recreational fishery once accounted for about 78% of the total number of individuals caught (Schirripa and Goodyear 1994). In 2002, the recreational fishery represented about 65% of the total catch of this species (Dayton <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;Commercial landings declined markedly after 2002-2003 with current landings continuing to be far below historic levels today. That decline is attributed to a combination of reduced management measures as well as mortality from a severe red tide event in 2005. According to a fisheries model that accounted for substantial declines in fishing mortality due to increasingly restrictive management regulations active since the 1990s, this species was expected to undergo a strong recovery after 2012 (SEDAR33 2014).&#160;However, the status of this species in the Gulf of Mexico is uncertain according to various updated model predictions. The most recent update of the SEDAR33 (2014) stock assessment published in 2016, applied two different models to estimate spawning stock biomass in the Gulf of Mexico, and the results from these contradicted each other. One model, referred therein as the Continuity model, concluded that the stock is not overfished and not undergoing overfishing. The second model, referred therein as the Alternative model, concluded that the stock is overfished with overfishing occurring. Both models have certain technical uncertainties associated with the data, but reports from recreational and commercial fishers that landings have not increased as of 2013, 2014 and 2015 despite continuous effort and management measures is a strong indication that the increase in abundance predicted by fisheries models in SEDAR33 (2014) has not been realized. In addition, the commercial CPUE index declined by 80-83% from about 2004-2009, and no data are presented for years following 2009, but catch has reportedly remained low (SEDAR33 2016 update). A commercial individual fishing quota (IFQ) system was initiated in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, which is where most of the landings for this species occur, but regardless of the increases in quota, the commercial fishery caught about the same mass of fish from 2010 to 2015. Commercial landings have declined by about 72%, from a high of about 800 mt in 2005 to a low of about 225 mt in 2010 and remained thereafter around 250 mt through 2015, and the fishery was not able to meet the quota for at least 6 years running now (SEDAR33 2016). A similar pattern of decline also occurred in all sectors of the Gulf of Mexico recreational fishery in recent years; the recreational fishery (numbers of fish) and the commercial fishery (gutted weight) both show the same decline in recent years (SEDAR33 2016). <br/><br/>The current official status of the species in the U.S. is considered not overfished with overfishing not occurring since fishing mortality in 2012 (the terminal year of the SEDAR33 2014 assessment) was below the threshold, and the projected fishing mortality in 2013 (based on landings for that year which were below the quota) was also below the overfishing threshold. However, authors of the SEDAR33 2016 update reported consistent overestimations of spawning stock biomass in previous assessments, and that the stock status may not have been as robust as previously concluded. Furthermore, this species was previously considered overfished for the majority of the time-series (1966-1999, 2002-2003, and 2006-2011) until it was no longer considered to be undergoing overfishing by about 2010 (SEDAR33 2016). The Alternative model, indicates that<span style=""""""""> spawning stock biomass declined by 58% from 1963-2015 (a period of 52 years); however,&#160;</span><span style="""""""">catch statistics for groupers were lumped prior to 1986 and fishers and fish house owners misidentified them as Black Grouper, when in fact, only a tiny fraction of the catch in the Gulf was Black Grouper</span>, which introduces significant uncertainty when identifying species-specific trends for that time period<span style="""""""">. Furthermore, the fishery for <em>Mycteroperca microlepis </em>was minor<em>&#160;</em>until increasing in the 1970s. The fishery statistics for the Gulf were improved by the 2000s, and the catch was increasing until 2005, but then started to decline particularly due to the low proportion of males and the continued commercial targeting of spawning aggregations&#160;</span><span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">(C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018)</span><span style="""""""">.</span><span style="""""""">&#160;</span><span style="""""""">A likely contributing factor to the lack of recovery is the continued low numbers of males in the population due to effects from fishing selectivity for males during spawning season&#160;primarily by the commercial fishery (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Throughout its U.S. range, the proportion of males in this protogynous species has declined dramatically from 15-25% males in the 1970s to 1-5% in the 1990s and that the proportion remains low to the present (Koenig<em> et al</em>. 1993, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 1996, Coleman <em>et al</em>. 1996, McGovern <em>et al.</em> 1998, Burns and Robbins 2003, Ward and Brooks 2010). Another study suggested that size at first maturity had also declined (McGovern&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998).&#160;The effect of this extreme change in sex ratio and reduction of spawning aggregations undoubtedly decreases reproductive output, but the extent of the decrease or its overall effect on recruitment is not clear. According to a study on genetic diversity of this species on the West Florida Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, the estimated effective population size remains large (with some uncertainty) and that genetic drift should not be adversely affecting adaptive potential; however, the effective population size is in decline due to fishing pressure and the trend is predicted to continue (Jue<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;</span><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>U.S. South Atlantic:</strong>&#160;Landings of this species in the U.S. South Atlantic were first recorded in the 1960s, and in 1973, individuals landed from offshore waters in areas where spawning aggregations occur off North and South Carolina were almost always greater than 80 cm total length, but after 15 years of intensive fishing, almost no individuals larger than 80 cm were taken in the recreational fishery (Huntsman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Previously unexploited spawning aggregations of&#160;<em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. phenax</em>&#160;comprised of hundreds of individuals were observed in 1980 by Gilmore and Jones (1992) during manned submersible dives in the Oculina Banks off Ft. Pierce, Florida. Observations from subsequent manned submersible dives at this site by Koenig, Gilmore and Grimes during the spawning season in 1995 found no individuals of this species and only one small aggregation (eight individuals) of small&#160;<em>M. phenax</em>&#160;and the percentage composition of this species relative to all reef fishes on Jeff’s Reef declined from 4.8% in 1980 (n=4,375) to 0.07% in 1995 (n=1,399) (Koenig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000).<br/>The U.S. South Atlantic stock was first assessed in 2006 (SEDAR10), and at that time, the stock was not overfished but was undergoing overfishing. The most recent stock assessment update, SEDAR10 (2014), concluded the stock was not overfished but was undergoing overfishing (fishing mortality is too high). Spawning stock biomass declined until the mid-1980s and has since been relatively stable, with some increases in recent years; however, this biomass was projected to decline in the years immediately after 2012 due to poor recruitment events in 2010 and 2011. Over the entire time series (1962-2013), spawning stock biomass declined from about 4,500 mt in the early 1960s to 1,683 mt in 2013, which represents a 63% decline over 51 years. During that same time period, total biomass declined by 66% from about 8,200 mt in the early 1960s to 2,744 mt in 2013 (SEDAR10 2014).<span style="""""""">&#160;</span><span style="""""""">In addition, commercial CPUE declined by 30% from 2005-2011; however, similar to the Gulf of Mexico, catches of this species were also lumped with other groupers prior to the mid-1980s, and possibly even more recently, which introduces significant uncertainty to interpreting population trends from these biomass and CPUE models (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). The quota in the South Atlantic has limited commercial landings to around 300,000 lbs, but fishers have not been able to reach it in recent years even though the quota is set low relative to historical catches, also similar to the Gulf. For example, in 2017, landings in the South Atlantic were 57% of the quota, and overall, commercial landings declined by 39% from 442,760 lbs in 2009 to 268,191 lbs in 2015 (see <a href=""""http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/acl_monitoring/commercial_sa/index.html"""">http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/acl_monitoring/commercial_sa/index.html</a>).</span><span style=""""""""></span><span style=""""""""><br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>A survey conducted in northern Yucatan, Mexico from 2000-2001, captured 928 immature specimens of this species (Renán <em>et al</em>. 2004). At least 18 grouper species are exploited commercially in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets. The Mexican inshore artisanal or small-scale fishery targets juveniles, while the Mexican and Cuban offshore fishery mainly targets adults. The commercial fishery occurs mainly on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76%) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). The most important species by catch and weight for the inshore fishery is <em>Epinephelus morio</em>, followed by <em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em>. <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em> is apparently a minor component of the Mexican grouper fishery, where it represents about 1-2% of the total finfish catch by the Mexican offshore Campeche Bank fishery (Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, F. Arreguin-Sanchez pers. comm. to C. Koenig). The Mexican grouper fishery is considered to be in an overall state of decline, and over the past 28 years (1984 to 2012), the average CPUE (kg per fishing trip) in the offshore fishery declined by 51% (SAGARPA 2012). The stock characteristics of <em>M. microlepis</em> remain largely unknown and landings, CPUE, catch composition and size trends from Mexican waters are scarce or not available (Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Yucatan, this species is recorded under the local name “abadejo” (Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, A. Aguilar pers. comm. 2016), but other Mexican states include other grouper species under the local name “abadejo”. Landings of “abadejo” in Yucatan, increased from 2 mt in 2006 to 36 mt in 2012 and then declined to 26 mt in 2014 (CONAPESCA <a href=""""http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad"""">http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad</a> accessed September 2016); however, confusion between <em>M. microlepis</em> and <em>M. bonaci</em> (and maybe other groupers) in “abadejo” landings render the validity of these data untenable. On the Campeche Bank from February 2007 to January 2008, immature females were frequently caught by both the Mexican inshore (96% of total catch) and offshore (21% of total catch) fleets (Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>This species is targeted by commercial hook and line, traps and longline fisheries that operate from Espirito Santo to Santa Catarina in Brazil. Data from official (unpublished) landings in Rio de Janeiro (FIPERJ), show a decline in catch per unit effort from 2011 a total of 3,432 kg captured in 26 landings, 648 kg in 11 landings in 2012, only a single landing with a total of 550 kg in 2013) and a single landing of 35 kg in 2014. Interviews with spearfishermen in Rio de Janeiro reported a 70% decline in catch of this species from 1980 to 2008 (28 year time period; B.

Current regulations include limited-entry via permits, a seasonal closure from March-April, catch size and recreational bag limits and total annual catch limits (Bacheler and Ballenger 2018).&#160;There are closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico (Madison-Swanson) and the South Atlantic where spawning sites of this species occur. In addition,&#160;<em>Oculina </em>banks that harbour spawning aggregations of this species have been protected since 2007. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the commercial fishery is managed under the IFQ program and there are no seasonal closures and certain gears are restricted. The recreational fishery is subject to a daily catch limit of 4 reef fish individuals and a closure from February-March beyond 20 fathoms depth, while Madison Swanson, Steamboat Lumps and the Edges (banks) are closed year-round. Further research is needed on the drivers behind the declines that have occurred in the southeast U.S. Atlantic (Bacheler and Ballenger 2018), and this may be realized in the planned 2019 stock assessment.&#160;There are no stock assessments available for populations in the Caribbean, and filling this knowledge gap should be prioritized.",Stable,"This is a relatively abundant grouper species, especially in the northern portion (southeastern Atlantic and U.S. Gulf of Mexico). It is not common, and not targeted&#160;in the southern Gulf off Mexico. In the southeastern U.S. Atlantic, it primarily occurs on the middle and outer continental shelf between southern North Carolina and Georgia (Bacheler and Ballenger 2018). Underwater point-count (video and visual) surveys indicate this species was the most frequent grouper in shallow waters (20-40 m) from Cape Fear, North Carolina (Burge<em> et al</em>. 2012). Previously unexploited spawning aggregations of <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em> and <em>M. phenax</em> comprised of hundreds of individuals were observed in 1980 by Gilmore and Jones (1992) during manned submersible dives in the Oculina Banks off Ft. Pierce, Florida. Observations from subsequent manned submersible dives at this site by Koenig, Gilmore and Grimes during the spawning season in 1995 found no individuals of <em>M. microlepis</em> and only one small aggregation (8 individuals) of small <em>M. phenax</em> (Koenig<em> et al.</em> 2000).&#160;Genetics studies indicate that connectivity between the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic populations likely occurs&#160;(Zatcoff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Overall, landings are relatively low for both the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic, with no more than a couple hundred tonnes taken annually. The U.S. Gulf of Mexico stock has not been formally assessed, but commercial landings in the Gulf over the past 30 years (1986-2012) were generally stable (landings peaked in 1986 at 175 tonnes and the most recent was 135 tonnes in 2012). Recreational landings have been generally increasing from 1995-2017 according to statistics collected by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. According to a 1997 stock assessment of the U.S. South Atlantic population, this species was not experiencing overfishing and was not overfished (Manooch <em>et al</em>. 1998, Potts and Brennan 2001). However, concern arose upon findings that sex ratios were skewed towards females and egg production was in decline due to the loss of larger, older females (Harris <em>et al. </em>2002). According to a fishery-independent study conducted via trap sampling from 1990-2016 along the southeast U.S. Atlantic coast (Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to Jupiter, Florida), the proportion of traps catching this species declined from a peak of 18% in 1994 to 2.5% in 2016 (86% decline over the past 22 years) and the species' relative abundance declined 92% from 1995 to 2016. An additional fishery-independent study conducted via underwater video across the same region&#160;from 2011-2015 also documented a 29% decline in relative abundance of this species over that time period. These declines are possibly due to recruitment overfishing and/or increased mortality on egg, larval, or juvenile stages. An updated assessment of this stock is expected in 2019&#160;(Bacheler and Ballenger 2018).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_unknown_status

The effectiveness of these measures are unknown and the species is not monitored. There is a ban on take of this species in Bermuda.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>U.S. waters: </strong>The Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC)&#160;manages this species in U.S. waters, and in 2005, the CFMC designated the grouper complex as overfished and undergoing overfishing, and commenced a 10-year rebuilding plan (CFMC 2005). In the U.S., the recreational fishery is closed from January 1 to April 30 and there are closed areas as well. Populations in U.S. Caribbean waters are managed under the Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan, which includes seasonal closures from February 1 to April 30 in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Spawning aggregations are also afforded some protection, including closed seasons at Grammanik Bank off St. Thomas from 1 February to April 30 and Lang Bank off St. Croix from December 1 to February 28 (Nemeth 2013). <strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Mexico:</strong>&#160;In Mexico, there is an annual seasonal grouper fishery closure from 1 February to 31 March (SAGARPA 2003, 2016); however, this provides little protection for this species considering its spawning season occurs largely outside this period (SAGARPA 2007, Caballero-Arango 2013, Caballero-Arango <em>et al</em>. 2013, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2014). Regulation of the commercial grouper fishery in Mexico currently consists of five main elements: (1) limits on commercial finfish fishery permits; (2) fishery closure&#160;for all grouper species; (3) a minimum size limit of 30.9 cm TL (2009-2010) and 36.6 cm TL (since 2010) for red grouper; (4) use of circle hook numbered 10/0-12/0 for inshore fleet and 14/0 or larger circle hooks for the offshore fleet (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b), and (5) a quota awarded to the Cuban fishing vessels operating on the Campeche Bank (Fernández<em> et al.</em> 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al.</em> 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). It is not known how effective these protective measures are.&#160;It is recommended to reduce the current fishing effort on mixed-species groupers to levels prevailing in the 1980s (estimated at 320 vessels carrying an average of six trips a year for each fishing unit and with duration of 15 days per trip). As a precaution, it is also recommended to reduce grouper fishing mortality by 20% within five years (SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). The establishment of a year-round no-take marine protected area at Bajos del Norte would probably be the most effective measure for managing grouper species that spawn at this reef (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Honduras:&#160;</strong>Nassau Grouper aggregations, which form at a similar time as Tiger Grouper, are protected from fishing in Honduras between December and March (Canty and Box 2015). The Cordelia Bank spawning aggregation site has been actively patrolled by the Roatan Marine Park in recent times, which may be a deterrent to fishers, although fishing effort within this fishery is low. Whilst the protection of grouper during spawning season is vital, but they should also be afforded protection during other times of the year (Canty and Box 2015).",Decreasing,"This species is apparently not a naturally common species. It was of relatively minor commercial importance in the Caribbean region until the 1990s (Heemstra and Randall 1993).&#160;From the 1990s onwards, targeted fishing pressure increased steadily over time, and pressure is almost entirely on aggregations, except where non-aggregation fishing has been documented in Honduras (Canty and Box 2015). According to underwater surveys conducted across the Tropical Western Atlantic from 1993-2016, this species had low densities in all areas (REEF database&#160;accessed October 2016). There is evidence of serious declines in several spawning aggregations; however, species-specific information is not available in most areas. There are relatively few spawning aggregations known for this species as compared with most other aggregating groupers in the Caribbean region. According to the SCRFA database (accessed October 2016), 10 spawning aggregations have been documented for this species (2 in Puerto Rico, 1 in Turks and Caicos, 2 in Belize, 1 in the Bahamas, 1 in the Virgin Islands, 1 in Mexico, 1 in the Cayman Islands, and 1 in Honduras), but the statuses of most of these are poorly known. The aggregations in Puerto Rico are known to be in decline (Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 1994, Matos-Caraballo and Posada 2000, Sala<em> et al</em>. 2001, White<em> et al.</em> 2002, Heyman and Requena 2003, Matos-Caraballo <em>et al.</em> 2006, Nemeth <em>et al. </em>2007, Heyman and Kjerfve 2008, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).&#160;According to catch and catch per unit effort data, declines between 50-82% have occurred since at least the early 1990s in Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Honduras and likely elsewhere in areas where grouper populations are heavily exploited. Therefore, this species is suspected to have undergone a global-level population decline, but the lack of data in a large portion of its range prevents the estimation of percent decline at this time.&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Cuba:</strong> This species is reportedly common in western Cuba and is taken in Cuban fisheries, but fisheries statistics and aggregations are poorly known in Cuban waters (Claro and Valle 2013, R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). A study conducted in the National Park of Los Caimanes in Cuba reported spawning aggregation behaviour for this species (Quirós-Espinoza and Rodríguez-Moya 2007). <span style="""""""">According to underwater surveys conducted in Sabana, Cuba from 1988-2000 (12 years), this species declined by about 50% (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).&#160;</span><br/><strong><br/>Puerto Rico:</strong>&#160;Landings of this species in Puerto Rico have been and are primarily taken from a small number of spawning aggregations, and landings rarely occur in non-aggregation months (Matos-Caraballo pers. obs.). Annual catch from the well-studied El Seco aggregation in eastern Puerto Rico, which has been exploited since the 1970s, declined between 1995-1998 from 2,500 to less than 900 individuals<span style=""""""""> </span>(Matos-Caraballo <em>et al</em>. 2006), and catch was higher prior to 1995 (estimated 4,900 individuals; Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 1994), which may represent<span style=""""""""> a decline of 64-82%. In addition, catch per unit effort also declined after peaking in the mid-1990s, and landings declined by about 82% from 11 tonnes in the early 1990s to 2 t in 1998. </span>Three other neighboring aggregation sites have been reported by ﬁshers (La Iglesia and Caletas in Puerto Rico and Sail Rock off St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands; Matos-Caraballo and Padilla-Pena 2004, Lileystrom unpublished data), but from 1995 to 1999, all ﬁshing effort for this species took place at El Seco, with only limited ﬁshing at La Iglesia in 1999 mainly by spearﬁshers (Matos-Caraballo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Surveys conducted on the El Seco aggregation from 1995-1999 reported a decline in numbers of individuals of 4,985 to 2,016, which represents about a 60% decline over 4 years (Matos-Caraballo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).&#160;From 2000-2003, there was little to no fishing on this aggregation as effort shifted nearer to shore and to other species. Some individuals were landed in 2004. Fishing effort was sex-selective with a focus on males (Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 1994, White <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stringent protections have been placed on Puerto Rico aggregations, which may allow recovery to occur.&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Mexico:</strong> Species-specific landings are not available from Mexico and all groupers have been typically recorded in the official statistics as “Mero”, although <em>Epinephelus morio</em> is known to comprise the largest proportion of the catch and <em>Mycteroperca</em> species are under various local names (abadejo, cabrilla, gallina, guacamayo; SAGARPA 2013). Since 2006, more species-specific landings have been recorded, but confusion between local names still introduces uncertainty (SAGARPA 2016). At least 18 grouper species are exploited commercially by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets through a sequential fishing operation pattern: the Mexican inshore artisanal fishery targets juveniles, while the Mexican and Cuban offshore vessels mainly target adults. The fishery occurs mainly in the southern Gulf of Mexico, on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76 %) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial fisheries operate on the Campeche Bank during the spawning aggregation season between February and May (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al.</em> 2004). As a result of overfishing, grouper populations have declined significantly in Mexico (Caballero–Arango<em> et al.</em> 2011). It is suggested that the Campeche Bank population is apparently healthier than populations in Cuba or Puerto Rico due to comparably larger maximum body sizes for both sexes on the Campeche Bank, and sexual transition occurring at a larger size in the Campeche Bank population than in the Puerto Rican population (White <em>et al.</em> 2002, Caraballo-Arango <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, this could also be attributed to a natural geographic difference. Aggregations that form at Bajos del Norte on Campeche Bank have been exploited by commercial Yucatan fishers since 1997, and in 2001, a single vessel harvested 2,435 kg of grouper at this site in just 10 days (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al.</em> 2003). In 2002, catches were between 56-88 kg/day during the month of May in spawning season (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). The overall male to female ratio was significantly skewed towards males at Bajos del Norte (Caballero-Arango 2013, Caballero-Arango&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013). Adult sizes in the 2001 and 2002 aggregations ranged from 38-49 cm for females and from 48-65.5 for males (Tuz-Sulub and Brule 2015). At the Cayo Arenas site, a single fishing vessel harvested an average of 340 kg of this species during two fishing trips (15-16 days each) between April and June 2004 (Tuz-Sulub 2008). Between 1996-2008, average landings of the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleet in Yucatan<span style=""""""""> declined by about 51% as compared to the 1970s. The Cuban fleet recorded a 66% decline in average catch per unit effort from 1984-2002 (18 year period; average of 6 kg per 100 hooks from 1984-1990 to 2 kg per 100 hooks from 1999-2002). The average catch per unit effort (kg per fishing trip) in the offshore grouper Mexican fleet declined by 51% between 1984-1990 and 1995-2008 (average&#160;</span>2,800 kg/fishing trip between 1984-1990, 1,800 kg/fishing trip between 1991-1995 and 1,400 kg/fishing trip between 1996-2008; SAGARPA 2012). Body sizes of individuals of this species collected at Bajos del Norte from 2008-2009 ranged from 32.7-81 cm fork length, which was larger than individuals observed at the same reef from 2001-2004 (38.5-68 cm total length; Tuz-Sulub 2008, Caballero-Arango 2013, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). At Cayo Arenas north of Yucatan in 2004, 30 individuals of this species were collected and ranged in size from 35.4-79 cm total length (Tuz-Sulub<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Honduras:</strong> This species is taken by Honduran fisheries during the spawning season from December to March, as well as other times of the year (Canty and Box 2015). A multi-species grouper spawning aggregation site on Cordelia Bank where this species has been observed has<span style=""""""""> reportedly declined due to overfishing, b</span>ut continues to exist albeit at low numbers&#160;(Canty and Box 2015). Industrial fishing catch across Honduran waters from 1950-2010 indicate that this species comprises about 2% of grouper catch by weight (Funes <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Bahamas:</strong> Populations of this species and other larger groupers in the Bahamas are suggested to be healthier (e.g., larger body sizes and greater abundance) in the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park protected area as compared to other areas in the country.&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>United States (continental):</strong> There are no landings recorded in U.S. waters, and the species has been observed at low levels in underwater surveys there (REEF data).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Brazil: </strong>The species is considered overexploited or threatened with overexploitation in Brazil and is not protected there (Olavo<em> et al</em>. 2011).

It is especially impacted by fishers targeting spawning aggregations (Claro and Lindeman 2003).&#160;This species has been identified in the diet of the invasive Lionfish, but only juveniles are consumed (Villasenor-Derbez and Herrera-Perez 2014).","Currently, there are no species-specific conservation measures and/or fishing regulation for this species in Brazil. There is a size limit of 32 cm total length or 460 g on catch of this species in Cuba.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Caribbean: </strong>There are no known restrictions on trade in this species in any Caribbean countries. A series of conservation strategies have been proposed to protect the spawning aggregations in the Caribbean region, including area protection of spawning aggregations, implementation of monitoring programmes and restricting fishing gear (Luckhurst 2003). In 2005, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council closed Grammanik Bank off St. Thomas to fishing during the spawning season to protect this species (Kadison 2011). Also in 2005, an annual seasonal closure was enacted for this species in all waters of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Federal Register Vol. 70, No 208). The combined effect of the seasonal closure of the Grammanik Bank, the 22 year closure of the Marine Conservation District (MCD), a large marine reserve 4 km to the west, and the seasonal ban on harvest or sale of this species, has undoubtedly played a key role in maintaining the spawning population&#160;that currently exists on the bank (Kadison 2011).&#160;In 2002, the Belizean government enacted regulations that halted fishing in 11 traditional offshore spawning areas and established a four-month closed season for grouper fishing (<a href=""""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0304_030304_belizefish.html"""">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0304_030304_belizefish.html</a>).<br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico:</strong>&#160;Off Mexico, a seasonal closure for the grouper fishery from February 15 to March 15 has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA, 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure will be extended from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Further regulations for the Mexican grouper fishery include limitation of commercial fishing permits, gear restrictions and a minimum size limit for certain species (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). Reducing the current fishing effort to levels prevailing in the 1980s has been recommended as well as reducing grouper fishing mortality by 20% within five years. Further research is needed on other species such as <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>, <em>M. bonaci</em> and <em>M. venenosa</em> to determine their population status (SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). It is not known if the seasonal fishery closures have allowed this species to recover, but the closure season provides only partial temporal protection for spawning <em>M. venenosa</em>. The creation of a year-round no-take marine protected area at Bajos del Norte would probably be the most effective measure for protecting grouper populations in that area (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).",Decreasing,"In some areas, populations of this species are suggested to have been historically large (Heemstra and Randall 1993), but current populations are considerably reduced, especially due to intense exploitation on spawning aggregations. Species-specific fisheries data are limited. Overall, this species is suspected to have undergone global-level declines of nearly 30%, or possibly more, since 1980, which is a time period covering the past two generation lengths (36 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (18 years) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure.<br/><br/><strong>Bermuda:</strong> In Bermuda, landings of <em>Mycteroperca venenosa</em> declined in the 1970s and 1980s, and since conservation measures were put in place to reduce fishing effort, there has been some improvement in its population (Luckhurst 1996). <br/><br/><strong>United States (continental): </strong>In the continental U.S., commercial landings of this species have been relatively low since it first appeared in official statistics in 1984. Landings in the Atlantic states have been stable at an average of 1.6 metric tonnes per year over the entire time period (1984-2015), and landings in the Gulf of Mexico states peaked at 186 mt in 1986, declined thereafter, and have remained stable at an average of 1.5 mt per year from 1992 to 2016 (NMFS database <a href=""""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"""">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). Declines in catches are likely due to fishery regulations that reduced effort.<br/><br/><strong>U.S. Caribbean: </strong>Prior to the 1990s, this species was not heavily targeted in the northern U.S. Virgin Islands due to some limited ciguatera poisoning. Targeted effort increased in the 1990s to supply the expanding restaurant market, and as a result, between 2000-2004 spawning aggregations of <em>Mycteroperca venenosa</em> and <em>Epinephelus striatus</em> were reduced by about 30-50%. In 2004, the total spawning population of <em>M. venenosa</em> on Grammanik Bank was 900 individuals (Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2006). After years of heavy exploitation on Grammanik Bank, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council closed the area to all fishing during the spawning season of <em>M. venenosa</em> and <em>E. striatus</em> (February-May) in 2005 (Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2011), and some level of recovery has been observed. In Puerto Rico, landings of this species were not recorded until 1998, and over the 13 year period of 1998-2011, landings declined from a high of 11,208 lbs in 2000 to 802 lbs in 2011, which represents a 93% decline over a 11 year period (Matos-Caraballo 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Cuba: </strong>This species is common, but not abundant in Cuba. It is targeted by Cuban fisheries, including spawning aggregations, and there has been a more than 80% decline in landings since 1980 (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). All spawning aggregation sites of <em>M. venenosa</em> on the Cuban shelf have declined (Claro and Lindeman 2003). Across the four main fishing zones of Cuba, landings declined from about 35 tonnes in 1981 to about 6 tonnes in 2012, which represents about an 82% decline in 31 years (S. Valle pers. comm. 2018). This has not been an abundant species in the fishery.<br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>In Mexico, at least 18 grouper species are commercially exploited by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets through a sequential fishing operation pattern: the Mexican inshore, artisanal or small-scale fishery targets juveniles, and the Mexican and Cuban offshore fishery mainly targets adults. The fishery operates mainly in the southern Gulf of Mexico on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76%) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). The most important species by catch number and weight is <em>Epinephelus morio</em>, followed by <em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em> and <em>M. microlepis</em> for the Mexican inshore fleet, and by <em>M. bonaci</em>, <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> and <em>M. microplepis</em> for the Mexican offshore fleet (Colás-Marrufo <em>et al</em>. 1998, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Mexican grouper fishery is in an overall state of decline; over the past 28 years (1984 to 2012), the average catch per unit effort (CPUE; kg per fishing trip) of the high-value Mexican offshore grouper fishery declined by 51% (2,800 kg/trip between 1984 and 1990, 1,800 kg/trip between 1991 and 1995, and 1,400 kg/trip between 1996 and 2008). The Cuban fleet recorded a 66% decline in average CPUE over a period of 18 years (1984-2002; 6 kg per 100 hooks for the period from 1984-1990 and then declined to 2 kg per 100 hook for the period from 1999-2002). The population of this species on the Campeche Bank remains poorly known (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). Off Yucatan, M. venenosa is primarily targeted by commercial fisheries operating on coral reefs of the Campeche Bank such as Alacranes, Bajos del Norte and Cayo Arenas, and frequently during the time when the species forms spawning aggregations there (Colás-Marrufo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004, 2006, Tuz-Sulub 2008, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). As a result, some spawning aggregations have been severely reduced or are near extirpation (Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2012). At Bajos del Norte Reef, grouper catch by the offshore Mexican fleet reached a total of 2,435 kg over 10 fishing days in February 2001 (average 244 kg/day), and the most abundant species in the catch were <em>M. venenosa</em>, <em>E. guttatus</em>, <em>M. tigris</em> and <em>M. bonaci</em>. At the same reef, <em>M. venenosa</em> catch was 2,254 kg, 1,617 kg and 2,231 kg over 12 fishing days in March 2002 (average 188 kg/day), over 10 fishing days in May 2002 the average was 162 kg/day and in March-April 2004, the average was 223 kg/day (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2003, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). At Cayo Arenas Reef, <em>M. venenosa</em> catch was 580 kg and 450 kg over 14 fishing days in April-May 2004 (average 41 kg/day), and in May-June 2004, catch averaged 28 kg/day over 16 fishing days (Tuz-Sulub 2008). Sizes of <em>M. venenosa</em> individuals (32.5-98.5 cm fork length; n = 1,383) collected at Bajos del Norte by Caballero-Arango (2013) in 2008-2009 were similar to those observed at the same reef by Tuz-Sulub (2008) and Tuz-Sulub and Brulé (2015) in 2001-2004 (41.5-89.4 total length; n = 426). Two <em>M. venenosa</em> individuals of total lengths 85 and 92 cm were collected in 2004 at Cayo Arenas Reef (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>Species-specific landings are not available from Brazil.

While small, isolated populations have and do persist in California (e.g., King Harbor in Redondo Beach and La Jolla kelp beds in San Diego), there is no evidence of historically abundant populations in this northern portion of its range. Historical landings of this species in California represent fish caught in Mexican waters, but landed in California (Fitch 1949, Craig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006). Surveys of fishermen indicate this species was once more abundant in Mexico, and landings have declined over the past 20 years. A market survey conducted in the Gulf of California, Mexico reported individuals of this species that ranged in size and weight from 42.4 to 81.8 cm total length and 1.04 to 10.1 kg. Ninety percent of the fish surveyed were smaller than or equal to 70 cm total length, which is smaller than the length at sexual maturity (76.7 cm) and fish ranged in age from 3 to 7 years (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al.</em> 2008). The reported annual&#160;mean landings of this species in the southwest Gulf of California from 1999-2007 was 9.7 tons, and it was the 15th most important species taken by the small-scale reef fish fishery, representing 0.55% of total landings and 0.80% of total revenues (Erisman <em>et al.</em> 2010).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_unknown_status

The largest fishing grounds for this species occur in the North Sea, the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. It is also taken in the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast, Moroccan coast, Western and Eastern Mediterranean, and the Adriatic but in much smaller quantities (Bell, Redant and Tuck 2006).<br/><br/>Levels of fishery exploitation vary widely between individual stocks (Bell, Redant and Tuck 2006). ICES assessments indicate that many of the stocks with a long history of exploitation in the North Sea, to the west of Scotland and in the Irish and Celtic Seas, are fully exploited in terms of yield per recruit, but stock levels are relatively stable and with no evidence of recruitment declines (ICES 2003, 2004). New fisheries have developed over recent years on some large offshore stocks in the North Sea (notably the Fladen Ground and Norwegian Deeps) and there appears to be scope for further increases in fishing pressure on these grounds. In contrast. there have been declines in stock abundance in some southern areas, including the Bay of Biscay and, particularly, Atlantic shelf edge grounds around the Iberian peninsula, but it is not clear that recruitment declines have resulted from overexploitation (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010).<br/><br/>Trawling is the primary method of fishing. Vulnerability to trawling is strongly related to burrow emergence behaviour, and in areas where much of the fishing occurs in winter (e.g. the Farn Deeps grounds) there is a lower fishing mortality of females owing to the non-emergence of ovigerous individuals. Small creel fisheries also occur, notably in sea lochs in the west of Scotland. This is considered a more sustainable method of fishing than trawling, although there are concerns that larger numbers of ovigerous females are taken in creels (M. Bell pers. comm. 2010).","<p>There are a number of species-specific conservation measures in place to regulate the fishery of this species.

It commonly forms large schools in the water column. This species has been the number one reef fish export from Brazil since the 1960s and is considered overfished (Cunha <em>et al.</em> 2012; additional citations in the Population section).&#160;Juveniles utilize both vegetated and nearshore hardbottom areas than may be threatened by coastal development. Burial of nearshore hardbottom habitats by coastal dredge and fill projects can eliminate settlement habitat used by Yellowtail Snapper and other lutjanids in southeast Florida (Lindeman and Snyder 1999). Adults of this species are associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Since 1983, there has been a minimum size limit of 30.5 cm (TL) for this species caught in both the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). Fish must be landed with head and fins intact. In the recreational fishery there is a bag limit of 10 fish per person. Similar regulations exist for the Caribbean Fishery Management Council. In Cuba, the minimum size is 25 cm FL (27 cm TL ≈ 250 g) (R. Claro pers. comm. 2015).&#160;This species occurs in marine protected areas of variable effectiveness throughout its range. The roles of enhanced use of local ecological knowledge in the management of this and other snappers is discussed in Begossi <em>et al</em>. (2012). At marine protected areas in the Abrolhos reef system of eastern Brazil, evidence of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to the boundary) was marginally significant for <em>O. chrysurus</em> (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008b).",Decreasing,"In the US, this species primarily occurs in Florida and is fished recreationally and commercially. Commercial landings for the years 1985-2010 show it was mostly targeted off South Florida. Landings increased through the 1980s and early 1990s, then experienced a decline from the mid 1990s until 2008-2013 when landings increased again (NMFS 2015). A stock assessment in 2003 indicated that estimated total biomass and spawning stock biomass in the southeast US had been relatively stable over the prior 20 years (1981-2001) (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). The age structure and growth off southern Florida had changed little in two decades of heavy fishing (Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2003). There is evidence that stock and spawning biomass has been increasing off Florida since 2001, the number of older fish has been increasing, and fishing mortality rate has generally been declining with a slight upturn in recent years (O'Hop<em> et al.</em> 2012). Considering these factors, the 2003 and subsequent 2012 stock assessment concluded that this species is not overfished in the southeast US, nor currently experiencing overfishing (O'Hop <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Off Cuba, it is considered to be common and is an important fishery resource. Over a period of approximately 15-20 years, landings for this species in Cuba declined by over 50% (Claro and Lindeman 2008). In the early 1960s, catch and effort increased due to the introduction of bottom trawls and an increase in trap numbers. After 1987, catches declined partly due to the high mortality of juveniles taken in trawls. The majority of the catch occurred in Archipelago Jardines de la Reina and the Gulf of Batabano. Decreases in trawler size in the past allowed for more efficient release of juveniles from nets, but it is not yet clear if this has been effective. Specific spawning aggregation sites are not clearly located; however, there is evidence that pre-spawning individuals were targeted by the fishery during migration to spawning sites (Claro<em> et al</em>. 2009). Ocean circulation modelling suggests limited larval connectivity between Cuba and US waters (Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>This species is caught as bycatch in the commercial fisheries for <em>Lutjanus campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) off Mexico. As catch of <em>L. campechanus</em> has been declining, exploitation of species such as <em>L. synagris </em>(Lane Snapper) and <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been increasing (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial and artisanal fisheries for Yellowtail Snapper occurs throughout the tropical, western Atlantic and average landings from the Caribbean for 1997-2000 have been 3,458 mt (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160;In the Caribbean, Mexico is the highest producer of&#160;Yellowtail Snapper&#160;with average landings of 1,413 mt per year (1997-2000), followed by the US with an average of 747 mt per year, and Cuba with an average of 498 mt (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species is subject to high fishing pressure in Columbia and Venezuela (Acero and Garzon 1985, Cervigon <em>et al</em>. 1992).<br/><br/>Brazil is the main exporter of this species worldwide (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2005). The population of this species off Brazil is considered to be genetically separate from the Caribbean (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is one of the most fished species of snappers in Brazil (Begossi <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Abrolhos region from 2001-2005, this species represented 3.1% of estimated total biomass (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008a), and is considered second in the rank of catch in biomass after <em>L. analis</em> in northeastern Brazil (Begossi <em>et al.</em> 2012). A study of this species in northeastern Brazil from 1998-2000 found a decline in mean abundance indexes, which was likely caused by the increasing effort targeting this species (Nobrega <em>et al</em>. 2009). In northeast Brazil, a virtual population analyses based on a short-data series estimated that this species was overexploited by the hand-line fishery, and a higher yield per recruit would be obtained by a 43% reduction in effort (Gomes de Mattos and Maynou 2009). Stock assessments in the central coast of Brazil (Klippel <em>et al</em>. 2005) indicate that <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been severely overfished. Freitas <em>et al</em>. (2011) suggest that exploitation also occurs in spawning areas.

Many subpopulations of Sockeye in British Columbia were found to be threatened based on this assessment. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for salmon management and is currently formulating conservation units (Holtby and Ciruna, unpublished manuscript) and initiating new policy (e.g,. Wild Salmon Policy) and procedures to stem the loss in diversity (DFO 2005, Irvine and Fraser 2008). Two locations of Sockeye Salmon, Sakinaw Lake and Cultus Lake, have been assessed and listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). However, the federal government has declined protection under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) due to the social and economic costs of closures to the fishery (Irvine <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005). We encourage COSEWIC and DFO to focus attention on those subpopulations that we identified as threatened in this IUCN assessment.<br/><br/>2. We considered Ozette Lake, Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake Sockeye Salmon as individual spawning sites in a larger subpopulation (SEASONAL UPWELLING). These lake systems are recognized individually as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The latter two sites were not included in the genetic baseline applied in this assessment, thus we assumed all sites are members of a larger, parent subpopulation. Further, we did not include Ozette Lake in our assessment given the recent escapement data available for the native beach-spawning population at that location is obscured by repeated attempts at establishing a tributary spawning population originating from broodstock taken from outside the basin. We encourage efforts at expanding the range-wide microsatellite-DNA baseline to include Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake, and to investigate the status of the native beach-spawning Sockeye in Ozette Lake.<br/><br/>3. Most of the data used in our assessment, particularly in Alaska, were from large aggregate stocks that may contain many (sometimes 100s) of individual spawning sites, and hence may mask important dynamics occurring at small scales. While a number of recent studies have shown that there is a significant degree of coherence among populations within a given region, it is important to acknowledge that a majority of the variability in vital rates are not explained by regional, environmental drivers, and may result from localized threats, for example road or other infrastructural development, or by different life history characteristics which affect productivity. Where possible and feasible, we recommend a more comprehensive monitoring approach that addresses dynamics at the scale of individual spawning sites. An excellent example of this approach is the Wood River system in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, where a combination of sampling approaches provides a more integrated monitoring system that translates into a robust assessment of the status of the species in that basin.<br/><br/>4. Mixed-stock fishing is likely to be a key factor in the decline observed at many sites and subpopulations in our assessment. We feel a key priority is filling a gap in knowledge about composition of mixed-stock harvest in coastal Sockeye Salmon fisheries. While a great deal of resources has been invested in developing weak-stock management for Fraser River Sockeye Salmon through the Pacific Salmon Commission and DFO, there has been much less attention placed in other regions along the west coast of North America, particularly in the regions where we found the greatest diversity of subpopulations. We encourage continued investment in developing methods and protocols to account for subpopulation composition of coastal fisheries targeting Sockeye salmon to help track harvest pressure at a biologically and ecologically meaningful scale. Further, we encourage fisheries management agencies to explore restructuring fisheries in a way that would result in shifting fishing pressure from coastal regions to more terminal locations, thus providing a more effective means of controlling fishing pressure at the scale of individual subpopulations.<br/><br/>5. Another leading factor threatening Sockeye Salmon are poor marine survival rates. This has been documented in cases where smolt-to-adult survival rates are estimated through intensive monitoring programs. This appears to be a significant factor explaining declines in adult abundance across many locations in the southern range of the species in North America. While marine conditions have been shown to cycle based on climate forcing and may, in fact, improve in future years, we feel it is important for those managing salmon in this region to acknowledge that poor marine survival may persist, particularly given projections based on global climate change. Reversing declining trends in those subpopulations affected may require increased attention to agents of mortality that are occurring at other life history stages over which we have more local control.<br/><br/>6. Many previous attempts at re-introductions of Sockeye Salmon have been unsuccessful, and we feel any effort at captive breeding or inter-basin transfers for reintroduction purposes should proceed with great caution. These efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild. The lack of success from the captive breeding of endangered Sakinaw Sockeye Salmon by DFO, and endangered Redfish Lake Sockeye by NMFS, are examples of the limitations to these expensive measures. Recent evidence of re-establishment of anadromous runs of Sockeye from remnant, isolated Kokanee populations following dam removal or modification (e.g., Allouette Lake in British Columbia) may offer hope in re-establishing anadromous life histories in cases where dams have prevented passage.<br/><br/>7. Enhancement activities (particularly hatchery releases and spawning channel construction) is likely to be a key factor in reducing abundance in neighbouring, small wild populations. In our assessment, we were unable to functionally track both wild and enhanced Sockeye Salmon where they intermingle. We strongly recommend adoption of integrated monitoring programs that includes a robust marking program and monitoring efforts targeted toward wild Sockeye Salmon populations that would provide the data necessary to address the degree to which enhancement practices threaten wild Sockeye Salmon. It is important to note that two large basins in our assessment (Fraser and Skeena) are all strongly. influenced by enhancement activities, and these activities likely represent a key factor threatening many neighbouring subpopulations.<br/><br/>8. While not addressed in the present assessment due to lack of data, we feel there should be more focused research attention on sea-and river-type Sockeye that may serve as colonizers in the future. This line of research is particularly important given expected habitat alterations from climate change.<br/>&#160;<br/>9. Very few data were available to assess population viability of Sockeye Salmon in the Russian Far East, and we document a significant reduction in escapement in recent years at a site within the Kamchatka River basin that warranted an endangered listing for this subpopulation. The leading threat recognized for this subpopulation is overfishing. The situation has been exacerbated by an increase in illegal fishing practices. We encourage the leading agencies in this region to provide more open access to data, and supporting meta-data, for assessment purposes. We also encourage development of new monitoring efforts throughout the region and increased enforcement to reduce poaching. Many populations of river-type Sockeye exist, particularly in western Kamchatka, and focused research on these populations will provide important insight into the status of the species there.",Stable,"At the species level, the population is believed to be stable; however, some subpopulations are declining.

For example, between 2003 and 2004, there was a 15,126 metric t reduction of fishing discharge, representing a 68% decline compared to the previous five years (Martínez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Similarly, in Nicaragua much of the population was fished out in the 1980s, and the availability of the fish has diminished such that the fishers have stopped taking it.","This species distribution falls partially into a number of Marine Protected Areas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific region (WDPA 2006).

However, this species had a high frequency of appearance, even though it showed a low relative abundance and biomass in the entire community (Bianchi, 1991). Based on fishing records, this species population fluctuates greatly and seems to be correlated with upwelling event. For example, during the last 5 years the catch in Panama has been between 33k and 60k t per year, with an average of 47.8 kt.

Individuals have been reported. In Cuba, landings have decreased by about 11% in the last 20 years (F. Pina-Amargos pers. comm. 2012). In Jamaica, evidence suggests that catches may also have declined in recent years (Harvey 2003). This species undertakes inshore migrations during the spawning season, when it incurs significant fishing pressure&#160;in Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Jamaica (Harvey 1986, Pena-Alverado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009,&#160;Grijalba Bendeck<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;<br/>In Mexico, this species is landed as part of a mixed-species clupeoid catch taken by beach seine and gillnet in small coastal fisheries. Mixed catches of clupeoid species (the majority of which are <em>Opisthonema oglinum</em>) represent about 58% of all landings in Veracruz and about 42% of those in Yucatán (SAGARPA 2012). Landings in Veracruz, which are primarily from beach seine fisheries, reached a peak of 1005 tonnes in 1997, decreasing to 42 t in 2008. Landings in small pelagic fisheries in Yucatán increased to a peak of roughly 4500 t in 1998 and then decreased to less than 100 t in 2008. This fishery is considered fully exploited/exploited to maximum sustainability (SAGARPA 2012).<br/>In 1969, landings of this species reported for the state of Florida equaled approximately 613 t, of which 64% were landed by commercial fisheries. Over 97% of the total state-wide landings were made on the Gulf coast (off Cape San Blas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor) (FWRI 2010). Recreational landings were made primarily in the northwest and southwest regions of the Gulf coast (FWRI 2010). The 2009 total landings were 45% lower than the average landings in the previous five years (2004-2008) and were 54% lower than the 1982-2009 historical average landings. On the Gulf coast, total annual landings increased from 300,000 pounds in 1982 to about 5.0 million pounds in 1994, an increase that reflected the market demand and expansion of this fishery in the early 1990s. Following the passage of Amendment 3 (which imposed significant limitations on marine net fishing) in 1995, landings declined; currently, annual landings fluctuate within the range of 1-4 million pounds. From 2002-2009, commercial landings rates have generally increased on the Gulf coast. Distinctly higher rates were reported during 2004-2006. Since hold capacity of boats is occasionally met, the landings may not be reflective of the true abundance or availability of this species. Likewise, recreational total catch rate estimates may not accurately reflect the use of this species as bait for recreational anglers because baitfish catches may not be accurately recalled, reported, or identified by anglers after the end of their fishing trips and fish may be released (ie., not landed) and not available for inspection during recreation surveys (FWRI 2010). Standardized YOY indices Gulf coast 1996-2005 vary without trend. Strong year classes 2006 and 2007, followed by decreasing trend through 2009. Post-YOY indices Gulf coast remained stable from 1996-1999, declined sharply in 2000, increased steadily through 2006, declined in 2007 (FWRI 2010). Analysis of importance baitfish species (including <em>O. oglinum</em>) in recent years (Mahmoudi <em>et al</em>. 2002) indicated no increase in abundance. Mean trawl catch rates for <em>O. oglinum</em> varied without trend. These findings suggest that factors other than fishing may have caused changes in the abundance of this species in the survey area (Mahmoudi <em>et al.</em> 2002).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Several recreational fisheries also target small tunas. Since 1991, the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by tropical purse seiners may have led to an increase in fishing mortality of small tropical tuna species (STECF 2009). There is a general lack of information on the mortality of these species as bycatch, exacerbated by the confusion regarding species identification (ICCAT 2009).","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place.<br/><br/>Data on the catch composition, biology and trends for small tunas are now available from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, thanks to the ICCAT/GFCM joint expert group in 2008.

The small tuna fishery seems to be quite important for the coastal communities, both economically and as a source of proteins. The SCRS suggests that countries be requested to submit all available data to ICCAT as soon as possible, in order to be used in future meetings. No management recommendations have been presented by ICCAT due to the lack of proper data, historical series and analyses. ICCAT/SCRS, in 2008, reiterated its recommendation to carry out studies to determine the state of these stocks and the adoption of management solutions.&#160; ICCAT-SCRS in 2009 noted that there is an improvement in the availability of catch and biological data for small tuna species particularly in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. However, biological information, catch and effort statistics for small tunas remain incomplete for many of the coastal and industrial fishing countries. Many of these species are of high importance to coastal fishermen, especially in some developing countries, both economically and often as a primary source of proteins. Therefore the SCRS recommends that further studies be conducted on small tuna species due to the limits of information available (STECF 2009).",Stable,"There is no fishery directed at this species.

It is a component of shrimp trawl bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico and many US states. There is species-specific information in some areas but little evidence of large regional declines. This species was considered at moderate risk of oil encounters (due to its spawning period and larvae dispersal) according to a study conducted within the seagrass meadows of the northern Gulf of Mexico from July 15 and October 31 of 2006-2010 (Fodrie and Heck 2011). Based on decades of on-water experience, many professional fishers think this species may be impacted by large-scale seagrass dieoffs in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon complex, where the species is heavily fished and sold as live bait to recreational, charter/for-hire and commercial fishers (T. Gibson pers. comm. 2015). In Florida Bay, very experienced fishers have concluded that chronic hypersaline conditions are inhibiting survival of invertebrates that provide forage for pigfish and deprive it of preferred salinity ranges. These hypersaline conditions are causing algae blooms that are killing seagrass habitats essential for the species (T. Gibson pers. comm. 2015).",There are limited or indirect conservation measures in place for <em>Orthopristis chrysoptera</em> among federal and state fishery management institutions.,Unknown,"This species is a locally abundant occupant of estuaries and occasionally nearshore marine waters throughout its range. It was recorded as one of five species with 88% abundance of all fish surveyed 21 km southeast of Dauphin Island, Alabama from August to November 2001 (Lingo and Szedlmayer 2006). It can be abundantly present in otter trawls and minnow traps (Petrik and Levin 2000). Of Terra Ceia Bay, Florida from May-November 2000, <em>O. chrysoptera</em> was the second most abundant species of teleost fish comprising 12% of the sample (Heupel and Hueter 2002).&#160;The species is recreationally and commercially sought on both coasts of Florida, with most landings on the Gulf coast, and juvenile pigfish are highly sought as a bait species. Based on FWC (2014), the recreational total catch rates for pigfish have remained fairly stable on the Atlantic coast since 1991. Pigfish total catch rates were stable with little variation on the gulf coast from 1995-2002, after which catch rates have declined through 2007 and increased through 2011 (FWC 2014). Indices of young of year pigfish abundance on the Atlantic coast show cyclic fluctuations increasing trends followed by drops in abundance in 2004, 2007, and 2013. (Fig. 4a). On the gulf coast there was a notable high in 1998 after which there has been a downward trend through 2006, followed by increasing abundances similar to historical levels in 2008-2013 (FWC 2014).&#160;The species is very common off Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico (M.

Mediterranean Benthic trawl effort has increased in both intensity and efficiency in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), and more recently effort has increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987). Since then half of the fishing effort has been displaced to targeting small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al.</em> 2001). In the southern Mediterranean and off the Tunisian coasts this species is fished at depths of 60 to 100 m, where it reproduces (Bradaï <em>et al.</em> 2002). It is considered rare in Tunisian waters and is taken as bycatch with no economic value (M.N. Bradaï pers. obs). Most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean is approximately 20 mm. Considering the large size at maturity (around 60 cm total body length), the exploitation of juveniles and probability of capture before breeding is likely to be high. The depth range of this species (60 to 660 m) lies entirely within the range of deepwater fisheries in the Mediterranean. Therefore it will not be protected by the ban on bottom trawling below depths of 1,000 m in the Mediterranean, adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in February 2005. According to Dulvy <em>et al. </em>(2003) the large spiny dorsal fins and relatively large body size, may make this species vulnerable to fishing exploitation, however Serena (pers. obs.) has commented that the species is of no commercial value in the Mediterranean and is usually discarded immediately because fishermen in the region believe that it brings bad luck. Discards have sometimes been observed alive (Serena pers. obs.), however, there are no data on the post release survival of the species and mortality is likely to be high given the depth at capture.  <br/> <br/>It is widely acknowledged that there has been a fairly rapid increase in deepwater fishing activities in the Northeast Atlantic with overall concern for the sustainability of deepwater fish stocks (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2003). <em>Oxynotus centrina</em> is known from depths which are entirely within the range of several longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries operating throughout the Northeast Atlantic distribution of the species. The species has already been shown to be vulnerable to being taken as bycatch in the Mediterranean and is also likely to be subject to bycatch pressure in the Northeast Atlantic. There is a continuing trend of increasing deepwater fishing activities in the Northeast Atlantic, while regulation is often lagging. Deepwater sharks are potentially at risk from these activities although little species-specific information is available. <em>Oxynotus centrina</em> may also be caught occasionally as bycatch in trawl fisheries off South Africa but there are insufficient data to support this and the taxonomy of specimens caught there remains uncertain.","There is an urgent need for the monitoring of landings and bycatch of this species and the collection of distribution and life history data in order to better understand the population structure and trends. The development and implementation of management plans (national and/or regional e.g., under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks: IPOA-Sharks) are required to facilitate the conservation and sustainable management of all chondrichthyan species in the region.",Unknown,"Relatively wide ranging.

<br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>
<br/>Catch data for <em>O. centrina</em> in the Mediterranean exists for the period from 1994 to 1999 (at depths from 10 to 800 m) as part of the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS). During this period, <em>O. centrina</em> was recorded in only 0.6% of tows, with the majority of catches made at between 100 to 200 m depth (STECF 2004). Regional biomass indexes indicate that the species is more common in the western central Mediterranean (Tyrrhenian, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily) with a lower biomass index in the western (Morocco, Spain and France) and eastern (Aegean) Mediterranean areas. During these surveys, it was found to be absent from the Eastern central Mediterranean (Adriatic, Ionian and Albania) (STECF 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Trawl surveys in 1948 indicated that the species was once present, though uncommon (0.21 % of hauls, 0.25% of surveys, estimated density of 1.15 kg km<sup>-2</sup>) in the Adriatic and the absence of the species in subsequent MEDITS surveys suggests that it may be locally extinct from the area (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2003). However, there have been recent records of juveniles caught in the central Adriatic (Lipej <em>et al.</em> 2004, A. Soldo pers. comm). Also, data collected during other (DESEAS) surveys of the Balearic Sea and Ionian Sea found one specimen in the western Ionian Sea at 800 m (Sion <em>et al.</em> 2004). Apparently then, <em>O. centrina</em> still exists in the Eastern central Mediterranean in unknown numbers.
<br/>
<br/>Between 1957 and 1960 <em>O. centrina</em> was captured in approximately 6% of hauls (n=27) in shelf surveys (coast to 150 m) and in approximately 6% of hauls (n=37) in slope surveys (150 to 800 m) in the Gulf of Lions, France (Aldebert 1997). Although it persisted in catches at low abundance up to 1992, it was subsequently absent in 139 hauls made during a trawl survey spanning 1994 to 1995 (Aldebert 1997), suggesting that the species is locally extinct from this area (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2003). MEDITS data for the period from 1994 to 1999 found lower abundances in the west than in other areas of the Mediterranean, although the species was present (STECF 2004).

There are indications of population declines and concerns with current conservation measures in place. In the Canary Islands and Spain, the present legislation of a minimum size landing limit is smaller than the size that this species achieves sexual maturity; this leads to increased vulnerability to recruitment overfishing and collapse of the exploited stock (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 2000, Velasco <em>et al.</em> 2011). An additional threats to this species is the susceptibility to exploitation in the multispecies fishery, given that it matures at a different size than other species. The Axillary Seabream is thus susceptible to exploitation at a size when many other coexisting demersal speceis are captured when they are mature or immature (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 2000).","In Spain, management for this species is based on minimum landings sizes, minimum mesh sizes, protection of juvenile areas and regulation of effort. Current legislation for <em>Pagellus acarne</em> includes a minimum landing size of 17 cm from communitarian waters and 12 cm from national waters in the southeast Mediterranean ports. There are some concerns that current fishing regulations are not sufficient in the protection of this species as males and females reach sexual maturity at sizes larger than the allowed minimum size of capture in the northern Alboran Sea. It is also recommended that an appropriate minimum landing size be established in the Gulf of Cadiz, where no current fishing regulations are in place&#160;(Velasco&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>In the Canary Islands, present legislation includes a minimum size of 18 cm; this needs to be revised as this minimum regulation length is smaller than the size at first maturity. It is recommended that other conservation measures such as closed seasons or changes in fishing pattern are considered to protect the spawning stock and the recruits (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 2000).<br/><br/><em>Pagellus acarne </em>is present in several marine protected areas within its range (World Database on Protected Areas, accessed 19 March 2014).",Unknown,"<em>Pagellus acarne</em> is an important component of commercial fisheries along the eastern Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea; it is a sought after coastal demersal resource in parts of its range. This species is common in most suitable habitats in the in parts of its range. Axillary Seabream is one of the main target species of small-scale commercial fisheries in the northern Atlantic: Algarve (Erzini <em>et al.</em> 2001), Azores (Morato<em> et al.</em> 2001), and the Canary Islands (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1994, 2000). <em>Pagellus acarne</em> is also considered a highly valued resource in the Mediterranean (Spedicato <em>et al.</em> 2002). In the northern Alboran Sea, this species is targeted by multi-species fisheries (bottom-trawl and artisanal fleets) and is considered the most important demersal fish species in terms of volume of catch and economic importance (Baro 1996).&#160;<br/><br/>The average global capture from 1950-2011 of the Axillary Seabream reported to the&#160;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Eastern Central Atlantic contributed the highest&#160;percentage of global landings, comprising 45% of global production over 61 years.&#160;The Eastern Central Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Portugal (contributing 77% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). The Eastern Central Atlantic is then followed by the&#160;Mediterranean and Black Sea; this fishing area&#160;comprising 31% of the global production.&#160;The total global capture reported from all FAO fishing areas was 58,392 metric tons (1950-2011).&#160;&#160;There is a general increasing trend in global landings for the Axillary Seabream reported from 1950-2011.&#160;<br/><em><br/>Pagellus acarne</em> is of high commercial importance and is targeted by demersal fleets operating along the eastern Atlantic coasts and the&#160;Mediterranean Sea. In the Eastern Central Atlantic (ECA), the stock is deemed overexploited as the current biomass is less than the target bioass, B0.1 (B<sub>current </sub>&lt; B<sub>0.1</sub>). The actual fishing effort is above the F0.1 effort; there is evidence that fishing effort is increasing. The Axillary Seabream population is considered to be a single stock in the ECA that is exploited by the high-seas cephalopod fishery, as well as the coastal and artisanal multispecies demersal fleets, not only by the coastal countries but also by the international fleet fishing in Morocco and Mauritania (FAO Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic, accessed 18 March 2014, Velasco<em> et al. </em>2011).&#160;The total aggregated landings of seabreams, and of<em> Pagellus acarne</em> in particular, have declined in recent years in the Mediterranean. In the Gulf of Cadiz, the landings decreased from a combined total of <em>c. </em>238 mt per year in 1993 to less than 120 mt per year from 2004 to 2007, a decrease of up to 60% (data from the Spanish Institute of Oceanography database from Velasco <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the Alboran Sea, landings have decreased from over 1,500 mt per year in 1985 (Gil de Sola 1993) to less than 250 mt from 2004 to 2008, representing a decline of up to 80% (data from the Spanish Institute of Oceanography database from Velasco<em> et al.</em> 2011). Similar declining trends have also been recorded in other areas such as the Atlantic coast of Morocco (FAO Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic, accessed 18 March 2014), the Canary Islands (Pajuelo and Lorenzo 2000), and the south of Portugal (Erzini <em>et al.</em> 2001, Coelho <em>et al. </em>2005).

The main fishery operates south of 26 N (Carpenter in press). <em>Pagellus bellottii </em>exists in three main stocks in west and northwest African waters: Rio de Oro (Western Sahara), Dakar (Senegal), and Takoradi (Ghana) (Le-Trong Phan 1972). The Takoradi stock is one of the most valuable demersal fishes landed at Ghanian ports and beaches (Koranteng 1984, Koranteng and Pitcher 1987). The Red Pandora is one of the main components of the demersal stocks off Senegal (Fall<em> et al.</em> 2006).&#160;The 'Guinea 90' Trawling Survey carried out in East Atlantic waters aboard the F/V Lagoapesca, a Spanish commercial fishing vessel revealed that the most abundant community to 200 m was the Sparidae, with a clear dominance of the Red Pandora (Ramos Martos and Fernandez-Peralta 1996).<br/><br/>The average global capture from 1950–2011 of the Red Pandora reported to the&#160;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Eastern Central Atlantic contributed the highest&#160;percentage of global landings, comprising 88% of global production over 61 years.&#160;The Eastern Central Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Ghana (contributing 71% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). The Southeast Atlantic makes up about 12% of the global landings with Angola contributing the most catch. The total global capture reported from all FAO fishing areas was 404, 085 metric tons (1950–2011). There is a general increasing trend in global landings for <em>Pagellus bellottii </em>reported from 1950-2011. <br/><br/>The Red Pandora is one of the main targeted species of the demersal fisheries in Senegal. Stock assessments from the industrial and artisanal fisheries from 1971-1999 in Senegal and Guinea show increasing abundance of <em>Pagellus bellottii </em>up to 1985 and a subsequent decrease of up to 80-90% in biomass for this species and for the White Grouper. Catches of <em>P. bellottii</em> in Senegal were made by individuals whose size varied between 10 and 41 cm. This species is recruited to two years and the artisanal and industrial fleets catch mainly young individuals aged two and three years, indicating a high fishing pressure on the stock. Overall situation of the stock of <em>P. bellottii </em>in Senegal was considered as being of concern in 2003 and it generated a loss of catch about 20 % below MSY (Barry <em>et al.</em> 2003). The increasing trend observed until 1985 was most likely attributed to the fact that this species was not targeted until the 1970s; an artifact that indexes during this period were based on commercial CPUE. Another plausible reason for this trend from 1971-1985 could be favorable environmental conditions for larval survival in the region. Total biomass reported from Senegal and Guinea has decreased significantly, with the most pronounced decreased observed for upper trophic level species, and for coastal species (sciaenid species assemblage). This trend of decrease in abundance of higher trophic level species was not observed for the Sparidae, as these species were found in deeper waters than the sciaenid community. The fisheries in these two West African countries differ in their catch composition because of prevailing environmental conditions in the region. For example, Guinea, characterized by turbid waters, is dominated by the scieanid community. On the other hand, sparid landings are more important in the demersal fisheries in Senegal (Laurans <em>et al. </em>2002). There have been substantial and significant changes in the trophic structure of the Senegal and Guinea ecosystems; the biomass of high trophic level species has decreased wheres the lower trophic levels remained relatively stable or have shown an increasing trend. In Senegal, the mean trophic level decreased significantly for both the catches and demersal community biomass. A similar decrease was also observed for the coastal demersal biomass in Guinea (Laurans <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>In Ghana,&#160;<em>Pagellus bellottii</em>&#160;is one of the main components of the multi-species coastal demersal fishery, and is captured by a variety nets (Armah and Nunoo 2007). This species recruits to the commercial fishery from about one to five years old and are fully represented in the catch at two years old when the mean length is <em>c. </em>16 cm. The minimum allowable mesh size (60 mm) selects fish of 15 cm and about 20 months of age; increasing the mesh size to 75 mm could potentially be a safer management option, selecting fish at 18.8 cm and 2.8 years of age. Furthermore, as this species is a relatively small fish in the West African multispecies fishery, an increase in the mesh size would probably not compromise management for other species (Koranteng and Pitcher 1987). Estimates the exploitation ratio in the Cape Coast area of Ghana indicate that the stock is overexploited (E = 0.7) (Asabere-Ameyaw and Blay 1999).&#160;<br/><strong></strong>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

There is historical evidence of overexploitation and population  collapse in at least one major fishery, in the Bay of Biscay (Lorance  2011). This species is heavily exploited and is closely associated with atmospheric oscillations and thus may be impacted by global climate change (Báez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","In Spain, fisheries regulations include: a closed season from Febraury and March, minimum hook size regulation, maximum number of hooks per line (set to 100), a maximum number of lines (30) and automatic hauling machines (three) per boat, and a minimum fish landig size (33 cm)&#160;(BOE No. 157 of July 2, 1998, Burgos <em>et al. </em>2013). Additionally, a European Union Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was introduced in 2003 as part of council regulation (EC) No. 2340/2002 of 16 December 2002 ﬁxing the ﬁshing opportunities for deep-sea ﬁsh stocks for 2003 and 2004 (Burgos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;In the Azores, fishery managers have enforced several measures to protect juveniles, although evidence indicates that effective interdiction of juvenile catch would provide a long-term increase of 15 and 8% in spawning-stock biomass and catch, respectively, as well as ∼13% increase in the value of landings. Although this measure could improve the protection of a species in an advanced state of overexploitation, results showed that a decrease in fishing effort would still be necessary to achieve sustainability of the stock (Pinho <em>et al</em> 2014).",Decreasing,"There is evidence of&#160;the existence of three Blackspot Seabream stocks in the northeast Atlantic: one in the Azores region (ICES Area X), one in continental Portuguese shelf/slope waters (ICES Area IXa), and one in the waters around Madeira (sub-area 1.2 of FAO 34, central-eastern Atlantic) (Hermida&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In the Mediterranean Sea it is locally abundant in some places in the Aegean Sea (K. Bizsel and B. Yokes pers. comm.), common along the Algerian coast (H. Kara pers. comm.) and common in southwestern France (P. Francour pers. comm.).&#160;<em>Pagellus bogaraveo</em>&#160;is common outside sea-cage forms in the Turkish Aegean Sea feeding on the feed (pellets) (Akyol and Ertosluk 2010), and accounted for 10.9% of the total weight of one fish farm from 2004-2008.&#160;<br/><br/>The average global capture from 1950-2011 of the Blackspot Seabream reported to the&#160;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Northeast Atlantic contributed the highest&#160;percentage of global landings, comprising 99% of global production over 61 years, the rest coming from the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Central Atlantic.&#160;Portugal and Spain are the main producing countries (Basurco&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The Northeast Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Spain (contributing 83% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). The total global capture reported from all FAO fishing areas was 381,648 mt (1950-2011). There is a general decreasing trend in global landings for&#160;<em>P. bogaraveo&#160;</em>reported from 1950-2011. FAO annual catch data for this species show a steady increase from around 50 to 140 mt to 2005.&#160;This increase is likely to be due to improved recording for this species.&#160;Catch fluctuated from 1950 and reached a peak in 1974 at 16,696 metric tons, landings decreased subsequently but reach another peak in 1977 at 12,500 mt. Landings have thus declined since the 1970s.&#160;The West African coast represents the southern limit of the geographical range of this species. This, together with its occurrence in deep waters, explains why the catches from the area are comparatively small<strong></strong>&#160;(Carpenter FAO ECA Guide in press).<br/><br/>The Blackspot Seabream fishery off the Strait of Gibraltar indicate that current exploitation levels have led to a decrease in landings and mean length of fishes landed since 2010, similar to the trends reported from the mid-1990s. The landings from 2005 through 2009 increased every year, exceeding the fishery's Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (Gil Herrera 2012). The fishery in the Strait of Gibraltar is carried out over bottoms from 350 to 700 m depth. The fishery in the area began in the early 1980s. The number of boats operating in the fishery increased from 25 boats in 1983 to more than 100 boats in the early 1990s, and slightly decreased to 94 authorized fishing boats in 2011, as a consequence of the regulations established in late 2009 by the Regional Government's (Junta de Andalucia) recovery plan for the Blackspot Seabream in the Strait of Gibraltar. The fishery is almost a single species fishery in which <em>P. bogaraveo</em> represents 74% of the total landings in weight and 91% in value (more than EUR 5 million in 2010). Landings from this fishery represents almost 70% of the total species landings in ICES Subarea IX (ICES 2012). The landings increased to about 854 tonnes in 1994, but declined rapidly to 282 tonnes in 1998; the decrease in landings rose some serious concerns prompted monitoring from the Instituto Espanol de Oceanografica (IEO) (Burgos <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>From the 1950s to the 1970s, Blackspot Seabream was exploited mainly by French and Spanish bottom offshore trawlers, by artisanal pelagic trawlers in the eastern Bay of Biscay (ICES Divisions VIIIa,b), and by Spanish longliners in the Cantabrian Sea (ICES Division VIIIc), with smaller contributions from other fisheries (Sanchez 1983, Dardignac 1988). The stock in the Bay of Biscay collapsed during the period 1975–1985, and it has not been of significant fishery interest since. Since the 1980s, it has been mainly a bycatch in France, and only a few small-scale handliners have been targeting the species (Lorance 2011). In the late 1960s, trawlers from La Rochelle, the main French port for landings of Blackspot Sea Bream throughout the twentieth century, redirected more effort towards this species as a result of the declining catch rates for hake (Guichet<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1971). Guichet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1971) noted no sign of overexploitation and reported a large proportion of individuals aged 10 and older in the catch. Seven years later, a severe drop in landings was reported (Njock 1978), and from the mid-1980s, it was clear that the stock had collapsed (Dardignac 1988). Based on FAO landings data for the Northeast Atlantic for 1972–2002, Blackspot Sea Bream was classified as a depleted species, and it is one of the few species whose landings had already declined to low levels by the early 1980s (Caddy and Surette 2005).<br/><br/>FAO capture production figures in 2012 were: Croatia two tonnes; Cyprus two tonnes; Portugal 740 tonnes; France 90 tonnes; Netherlands nine tonnes; Spain 236 tonnes; and United Kingdom three tonnes.<br/><br/>The  Blackspot Seabream has traditionally been the main target species of  the bottom longline fishery in the Azores, but in recent years several  other species have increased in economic importance, including the  Axillary Sea Bream, <em>P. acarne</em> (Morato <em>et al.  </em>2001). From 1981 to 1994 Blackspot Sea Bream represented 26% of total  landings and 38% of total income of the demersal fisheries in the  Azores. During this period, landings of this species increased by about  240% while an overall decrease in relative abundance was observed in the  Azores (Menezes and Silva 1999).<br/><br/>The fishery of Blackspot Seabream in Greek waters since the beginning of the 1980s were carried out mainly by long lines. In recent years, gill nets and trammel nets have been used in the Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea. Catches were extremely high during the early years of exploitation, with subsequent declines. In 1998, field observations in the Ionian Sea showed catch at 46 kg/1,000 m of netting; this decline in catch prompted a decrease in mesh size which lead to a number of negative outcomes: increased discards, lower market prices, higher pressure on the population, and reduction of the spawning stock.&#160;Similar declines in the total catch and the catch per unit of effort has been observed in the Strait of Gibraltar, in the ICES divisions VI, VII, VIII the stock is near to collapse, whereas the Andalucia region (Spain) government since 1999 has adopted a recovery plan for the stock. Generally in the Mediterranean the stock is heavily exploited and the biomass is declining, however, no other regulations are currently imposed on the fishery except the minimum landing size, which is set at 12&#160;cm and applies to all the&#160;<em>Pagellus&#160;</em>species (Chilari <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Populations in the Northeast Atlantic are structured regionally, with populations of&#160;<em>P. bogaraveo</em>&#160;in the Azores genetically distinct from those on the European continental shelf, off Portugal and Madeira. Although, Patarnello&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2007) showed very little or no population structure and no signs of Atlantic-Mediterranean division for this species.&#160;While this structure may be strongly influenced by historical factors (severe environmental effects of the last glacial maxima), current levels of gene flow have been insufficient to homogenize populations. This finding has implications for management of deep-water species at the regional level, in that migration between populations separated by major hydrographic features, such as ocean basins, is limited.&#160;The chance of a rescue effect from migration and dispersal from other populations to compensate for impacts of directed exploitation, in terms of both biomass and genetic variability, will therefore be diminished given this bottleneck (Stockley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

This species is therefore susceptible to exploitation at a size when many other coexisting demersal species are mature or immature.

This species has been subject to overexploitation in many parts of its range, although there is some evidence of recovery in some areas (Jackson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).","The Denham Recreational Advisory Committee proposed a number of management regulations in 1995 to limit recreational catches, including an overall possession limit and a species specific daily bag limit during the spawning season of&#160;<em>P. auratus</em>&#160;(Jackson and Moran 2012).&#160;In March 1996, the State Recreational Fishing Advisory Committee also recommended a range of management measures to protect <em>P. auratus;</em>&#160;these regulations included&#160;an increase in minimum size from 41 cm to 45 cm (TL), the introduction of a maximum size limit of only two fish greater than 70 cm (TL) per day per person, and a daily bag limit of four fish per person. However, these measures were not popular with large numbers of recreational fishers and were not supported by the Minister of the day, who requested further research to more adequately establish the status of <em>P. auratus</em> stocks (Marshall and Moore 2000).&#160;A moratorium on fishing of&#160;<em>P. auratus&#160;</em>in the Eastern Gulf of Shark Bay was implemented in May 1997 but was&#160;overturned in July 1997 due to public opposition (Marshall and Moore 2000). Although the Eastern Gulf fishery for this species was reopened, additional restrictions were implemented, including a slot limit of 50 cm to 70 cm (TL), a daily bag limit of two fish, and the main spawning ground being closed to all fishing.&#160;After the daily egg production method (DEPM) (Zeldis 1993) successfully assessed the stocks &#160;of <em>P. auratus</em>&#160;in Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand in 1992 (Zeldis and Francis 1998), and in northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia in 1994–1995 (McGlennon 2003), DEPM surveys were undertaken in Shark Bay from May to September 1997. The results of the surveys from the Eastern Gulf warranted the closing of the fishery in June 1998 and this fishery remained under moratorium until March 2003. By 2001, most of the stock had recovered to <em>c. </em>40% of its unexploited biomass, but the Freycinet Estuary stock remained below 30% of the unexploited biomass, making an unexpectedly slow recovery. It was recommended that the daily bag limit for <em>P. auratus </em>in the Eastern Gulf and Denham Sound could be increased to two fish to permit recreational fishers to catch more while remaining within the overall TACs (Jackson and Moran 2012). The Quota Management System (QMS) was introduced&#160;in 1986 and Total Allowable Commercial Catches (TACCs) for all stocks of&#160;<em>P. auratus</em>&#160;in New Zealand were established to allow for some stock recovery (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).<br/><br/>Currently, in Shark Bay, recreational fishing regulations include a daily bag limit of two fish per person per day, a minimum landing size of 50 cm and a maximum size of 70 cm, a closed fishing season from 1 May to 31 July in the Eastern Gulf and 15 August to 30 September in the&#160;Freycinet Estuary (Department of &#160;Fisheries 2013).",Decreasing,"The commercial and recreational fisheries for <em>Pagrus auratus</em> in Australia comprise a national total catch of <em>c. </em>3,000 tonnes per year including Queensland (<em>c. </em>700 tonnes), New South Wales (<em>c. </em>500 tonnes), Victoria (<em>c. </em>500 tonnes), South Australia (<em>c. </em>900 tonnes), and Western Australia (<em>c. </em>600 tonnes)&#160;(Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 2012). The total national catch for New Zealand is <em>c. </em>14,000 tonnes per year (N.Z.

In Shark Bay, there are three separate stocks within the two gulfs and they are distinct from the stock in adjacent oceanic waters (Johnson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986, Edmonds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989, Moran&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Edmonds&#160;<em>et&#160;al.</em>&#160;1999, Bastow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Moran<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2003).&#160;Shark Bay in Western Australia is one of the most important locations for fishing of this species, and this fishery began in the early 1900s moving to the inner gulfs by the 1920s (Cooper 1997, Edwards 2000) with effort increasing until the 1950s and subsequently declining steadily in the 1960s and 1970s (Bowen 1961, Marriott <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The catch of&#160;<em>P. auratus&#160;</em>in South Australia has notably increased and this species has become the highest State-based contributor to the national commercial catch reaching 972 tonnes worth $6.5 million in 2010–2011 (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Commercial catches of this species in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay contribute around less than two tonnes per year (Cooper 1997). However, the commercial oceanic fishery in this area previously produced the largest catch of&#160;<em>P. auratus</em>&#160;in Australia reaching about 600 tonnes per year (Marriott&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Approximately 190 tonnes of this species was taken in the WCB, 263 tonnes in the Gasoyne Coast Bioregion (GCB) (Fairclough&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Jackson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012b) and 40 tonnes in the South Coast Bioregion in 2010/2011 (Molony <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;Recreational catches in this area were believed to be unsustainable by the mid 1990s and by 1995 the Denham Recreational Advisory Committee proposed a number of management regulations to limit recreational catches (Jackson and Moran 2012).&#160;The total estimated recreational boat-based catch in the WCB increased from 25 tonnes in 1996/1997 to 40 tonnes in 2005/2006 (Sumner <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) and subsequently decreased to 24 tonnes in 2009/2010 following the introduction of a variety of management measures during 2007-2009 (Fairclough <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). The total estimated recreational boat-based catch in the GCB was 30 tonnes in 2007/2008 and catch taken by charter vessels was 12 tonnes in 2010/2011 (Jackson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012b). Recruitment had reached very low levels in the late 1990s, indicating that the stock was seriously depleted (Jackson and Moran 2012). After the implementation of a moratorium and subsequent Total Allowable Catch (TAC), daily bag limits, and minimum landing size; most of the stock recovered to <em>c. </em>40% of the unexploited biomass by 2011 but this recovery has been extremely slow and the reasons for this are unknown (Jackson and Moran 2012).<br/><br/>In the WCB, the estimates of F for the entire stock (2008/09–2010/11) declined from the assessment period 2005/06–2007/08 but it was about 1.5 times the limit reference point of 0.18 year<sup>-1</sup>. In the combined northern management areas of Kallbarri and Mid-west of the WCB, F decreased and SPR (spawning per recruit) increased. Although F and SPR both improved between the two assessment periods, F was still extremely high and SPR very low. In the combined southern management areas of Metropolitan and South-west, F and SPR also improved and were much low and higher, respectively, than for the combined northern areas (Fairclough <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). <br/><br/><strong>New Zealand</strong><br/><br/>This species is widely distributed in New Zealand waters but is most abundant in the Hauraki Gulf. In New Zealand, catches peaked in 1978 at 18,000 tonnes but had declined to 8,500 tonnes to 9,000 tonnes by the mid 1980s with some stocks showing signs of overexploitation (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). The spawning stock biomass (SSB) of this species in New Zealand has decreased significantly since the 1970s in the east Northland, Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty. The SSBs from 2011 in all three areas were estimated to be below 20% with that in the Bay of Plenty estimated at below 10%. Model SSB trajectories for <em>P. auratus</em>&#160;for all three stocks after 2007 are either decreasing or have plateaued. Modeled five year projections indicate that current catch rates will not permit stock recovery in the eastern Northland or the&#160;Hauraki Gulf&#160;and will most likely decrease <em>P. auratus</em>&#160;abundance in the Bay of Plenty&#160;(N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).<br/><br/>Recent data suggest that <em>P. auratus</em>&#160;is increasing in abundance and has expanded its range in eastern Tasmania since the 1800s (Last <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;Populations of this species seem to be 'closed' over relatively small spatial scales and connectivity is relatively low (Curley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

There have been substantial population declines in the United States which have led to a number of management measures, including stock rebuilding efforts. The most common commercial gear has been hook and line, with historical commercial landings also from trawls and traps (now banned in the fishery).&#160;The average global capture from 1950-2011 of the Red Porgy reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Southwest Atlantic contributed the highest percentage of global landings, comprising 58% of global production over 61 years. The Southwest Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Argentina (contributing 84% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). The Southwest Atlantic is then followed by the Mediterranean and Black Sea, comprising 29% of the global production. The total global capture reported from all FAO fishing areas was 420,160 metric tons (1950-2011). There is a general increasing trend in global landings for the Red Porgy reported from 1950-2011; peak in landings were recorded in the early 1980s with subsequent declines in 1990s-2000s; a peak in 2009 at 15,455 metric tons (driven mostly from landings reported from Argentina) was recorded, representing a 13% difference from the maximum catch in 1981.&#160;<br/><br/>Despite the long-held notion that protogynous species are more vulnerable to exploitation than gonochorists, there was no evidence found for the northeast Gulf of Mexico, that this reproductive attribute in the Red Porgy partly led to the apparent crash of the stock in the South Atlantic Bight (DeVries 2005). In fact,&#160;<em>Pagrus pagrus</em>&#160;may be more resilient to exploitation in some cases given these aspects of its biology and behaviour: widespread spawning grounds (Manooch 1976,&#160;DeVries 2005), no tendency to form large, predictable spawning aggregations (DeVries 2005, Harris and McGovern 1997), absence of behaviourally-related size or sex selectivity, socially controlled sex change, co-occurrence of sexes year-round, and an extended period of transition (from ages two to nine years)&#160;(Roumillat and Waltz 1993, Cotrina and Christiansen 1994, Pajuelo and Lorenzo 1996, Costa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, Cotrina and Raimondo 1997, Kokokiris&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Hood and Johnson 2000, DeVries 2005). These reproductive attributes should stabilize or enable rapid compensation of sex ratios (preventing sperm limitation or disruption of mating). Socially controlled sex change should also enable size and age of transition to slide downward as fishing truncates the size structure, similar to the declines in size and age at maturity seen in many gonochorists (DeVries 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Landings by region</strong><br/><u><br/>Southeast United States</u><u><br/></u><u><br/></u>The 2012 stock assessment of this species for the Southeast United States indicated that rebuilding is not occurring as expected due to poor recruitment, and that the stock is currently not predicted to completely rebuild by 2018 (Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR), accessed 10 March 2014). &#160;Red Porgy is in an 18-year rebuilding plan that was established in 1999 though Amendment 12 to the Snapper Grouper FMP (South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, Decision Document, accessed 10 March 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Total landings from the three major fisheries operating in the Southeastern United States (commercial, recreational, and head-boat fisheries) &#160;increased during the 1970s and early 1980s as the commercial fishery expanded, with a peak of about 335 mt in 1972 to over 900 mt in 1982.

Results from the most recent stock assessment undertaken in 2012 suggest that the spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased since the benchmark assessment in 2002. The 1998 estimate of SSB is <em>c. </em>19% of SSB<sub>MSY</sub>, and the 2012 estimate is <em>c. </em>47%&#160;SSB<sub>MSY. </sub>The <em>F<sub>2009-2011</sub></em>/<em>F</em><sub>MSY </sub>estimate is <em>c. </em>64% and results suggest that the stock has generally been exploited below maximum fishing mortality threshold (MFMT) (defined as <em>F<sub>MSY</sub></em>) since the late 1990s. The 2012 stock assessment for the Red Porgy indicates that the stock is overfished (where SSB &lt; minimum stock size threahold (MSST)), but is no longer undergoing overfishing (Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Total abundance has been stable to slightly declining from 2006 to 2011. The strongest year class (age zero fish) were predicted to have occurred in 2002 and 2005. Total biomass and spawning biomass show general decline until approximately 1999 followed by a recovery through the mid 2000s. In recent years, the recovery of the early 2000s has flattened or slightly reversed&#160;(Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) 2012). Status of the southeastern U.S. stock of Red Porgy (<em>Pagrus pagrus</em>) was estimated from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data, 1972-1997. New analyses indicate that dramatic changes in age structure and population abundance have occurred over the last 25 years. Results describe a dramatic increase in exploitation of this stock and a con­comitant decline in abundance. Esti­mated fully recruited fishing mortality rate (F) from the primary catch matrix increased from 0.10/yr in 1975 to 0.88/yr in 1997, and estimated static spawn­ing potential ratio (SPR) declined from about 67% to about 18%. Estimated recruitment to age one declined from a peak of 3.0 million fish in 1973-74 to 94,000 fish in 1997, a decline of 96.9%. Estimated spawning-stock bio­mass declined from a peak of 3,530 t in 1979 to 397 t in 1997, a decline of 88.8%. Long-term and marked declines in recruitment, spawning stock, and catch per unit of effort (both fishery-derived and fishery-independent) are consistent with severe overexploitation during a period of reduced recruitment (Vaughan and Prager 2002). In the&#160;southeastern United States, from 1972-74 to 1979-81, the back-calculated size-at-age increased slightly for ages two to eight. By 1988-90 and 1991-94, the back-calculated size-at-age for the same age classes was significantly smaller than that in 1979-81. In addition, size-at-maturity and size-at-sexual-transition occurred at progressively smaller sizes for 1988-90 and 1991-94. The mean size-at-age (observed and back-calculated) declined for most ages between 1988 and 1994 (Harris and McGovern 1997). &#160;<br/><br/>The benchmark 2002 stock assessment for the southeastern U.S. concluded that this species was overfished at the time, but not undergoing continued overfishing (SEDAR 2002). Stock assessments indicated a declining population, and this in turn has led to a number of management measures, including a moratorium on fishing of this species in September 1999-August 2000. Simulations modelling how lack of fishery-dependent data would affect stock assessments of this species indicated that a 12-year moratorium would be needed for stock rebuilding in the southeastern USA. However, simulations showed uncertainty surrounding stock assessment estimates would increase after three years without fishery-dependent data (Davis and Berkson 2006).&#160;Fishery independent Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) and species composition data between the 1970s and 2005-2006 were compared for reef fishes in the vicinity of Onslow Bay, North Carolina. The CPUE of&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Pagrus pagrus</span>, was greater in the 1970s than in 2005-2006 at specific capture sites. Catch rates and composition may have differed owing to differences in captains' skills and electronics despite efforts to standardize the fishing methods between periods. Estimates of total mortality are generally inconsistent with fisher observations and agree with recent stock assessments concluding that important reef species, including&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Pagrus pagrus,</span>&#160;are overfished. Results suggest that fishing and possibly other variables have affected the abundance and mortality of major species&#160; in this fishery (Ruderhausen&#160;<em>et al. </em>2008)<em>. </em><br/><br/><u>Gulf of Mexico</u><u><br/></u><br/>The Red Porgy is very abundant in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is only lightly exploited, often taken as bycatch by fishermen targeting more desirable reef fishes (DeVries 2005). The population of this species appears to be centered in the northeast Gulf of Mexico; the Red Porgy is one of the most frequently observed reef fish in annual reef fish surveys in the area (C. Gledhill pers. comm. in DeVries 2005), and is one of the most commonly caught species on the Florida Middle Grounds (Manooch and Hassler 1978). Stocks of&#160;<em>Pagrus pagrus</em>&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States are considered separate due to genetic distance (Ball<em> et al. </em>2007). The Red Porgy is an important component of the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery, with most of the landings coming from Florida. This species is an important component of the Florida west coast commercial reef-fish fishery and ranked 13<sup>th</sup> in total weight of reef fish landed in this area (Goodyear and Thompson 1993). In Florida, commercial landings for the Red Porgy are not distinguished from other porgies. However, given that <em>Pagrus pagrus</em> made up <em>c. </em>50% of all porgies landed from 1995-1996, the combined west coast landings of this species were estimated at 0.5 million pounds. The recreational fishery landed an estimated 242,000 Red Porgy in Florida over the same period (1995-1996) (Goodyear and Thompson 1993, Marine Fisheries Information System 1997, Hood and Johnson 2000). In a study characterizing fishery bycatch for finfish taken by longline and vertical line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico, the Red Porgy was the fifth most abundant fish caught (seven percent of the total fish caught by number) by vertical line, and was also one of the top species to be retained (comprising 86% of the 63,351 individuals in the kept category along with Vermilion Snapper, Red Snapper, and Red Grouper) (Scott-Denton <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;<span style=""""""""><br/></span><p><span style="""""""">The Red Porgy comprise many phenotypically distinct local subpopulations (exhibiting different demographics/life history traits) within species at localities separated by no more than 10s of kilometers in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. These small-scale differences are most probably explained by spatial heterogeneity of their environment and site fidelity;<em>&#160;Pagrus pagrus&#160;</em>prefer live bottom habitats that are widespread but patchy and can exhibit variable hydrological, biological, geological, and ecological characteristics. In addition, adults of this species show high site fidelity, so once recruitment to a patch occurs, Red Porgy is exposed to the unique suite of factors in that particular area that may impact growth, mortality, and reproduction.&#160;</span><span style="""""""">It is important to examine this subpopulation structure at finer scales in order to adequately assess the status of these&#160;stocks&#160;and predict the effects of exploitation in these complex structures. This small scale population complexity has played some part in the failure of some southeastern United States reef fish fisheries to respond to management in recent years, given that fisheries have been managed in units which were based on a combination of biological, political, and administrative boundaries rather than individual spawning groups or sub-units of the population.&#160;(DeVries 2005). </span><br/></p><span style=""""""""></span><u>South America</u><br/><br/>In&#160;Brazil<strong>, </strong>stocks are considered to be depleted after prolonged exploitation (Haimovici 1998).<br/><br/>Fishing efforts have reduced the annual catches in&#160;Argentina<strong>&#160;</strong>from 15,000 t in 1980 to a present value of 2,000 t (SAGPyA-DNPyA 2004). Red Porgy is a candidate for aquaculture diversification in the Mediterranean (Kalinowski <em>et al. </em>2005) and is also a part of the aquaculture development project of the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (INIDEP), Argentina (Aristizabal 2003, 2006, 2007). <em>Pagrus pagrus </em>is one of the top three principal species in Argentina; with total landings in 2013 reported at 4,201.1 tons (production figures not distinguished between wild caught and aquaculture landings) (Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Pesca, accessed 10 March 2014).&#160;<em><em><br/></em></em><br/><u>Europe</u><br/><br/>FAO catch statistics for the Mediterranean Sea show a steady increase in landings over the past 50 years, with a fluctuation between 1,700 and 4,300 mt from 1996 to 2005. It is unclear whether this steady increase is only due to increased effort or perhaps improvements in data collection.&#160;In the&#160;Azores, results of a 10-year bottom longline survey and a smaller scale hook-and-line survey indicate that the size and sex of fish caught responded to local factors rather than fishing or larger scale (geographic) factors. Young-of-the-year recruit to shallow, sandy habitats located inshore, and apparently migrate toward deeper and progressively rockier bottoms. Significant large-scale differences among islands may be attributed to exploitation, and lowest abundances were consistently found off islands subject to higher fishing effort. Recruitment to the fishery varied twice by an order of magnitude during the 10-year longline monitoring period, reflecting high natural vulnerability (Afonso&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al.&#160;</span>2008).&#160;Off the southwestern coast of Turkey this species was once very abundant, but has declined to around 1/15th of its original population size (B. Yokes pers. comm. 2007). It is however common in Algeria (H. Kara pers. comm. 2007), other parts of Turkey (C. Bizsel and B. Yokes pers. comm. 2007) and in France (P.

There is an apparent significant decline in catch between 1993 and 1994, however without a greater time series, it is difficult to interpret this as a long term trend. Results from this study also indicate that a maximum sustainable yield of 60 tonnes a year for both the trap and trawl fishery would have been realistic; landings in 1994 and 1995 exceeded this limit which may account for the apparent decline in catch during this period.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>",Marine,yes,Invertebrate,spp_not_th

Closed seasons, where in force, appear to be the most effective management measure for the species.&#160; There are several marine protected areas that are closed or limit lobster fishing within their boundaries in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, although most of them are small.&#160; The exception is the MPA of Columbretes Islands, a 23-year old, no-take area of 55 km<sup>2</sup> off eastern Spain, where <em>P. elephas</em> has reached biomass levels 14 times higher than in fished areas, regional reproductive potential has increased by six (Diaz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and an annual net contribution of spillover from the MPA to local fishery yields of 13% has been estimated (Goñi <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010).</p>  <p>Information is needed on catches and effort in the major fisheries and how these have changed with time. Monitoring of CPUE data across all fisheries associated with this species is essential to determine the level of impact harvesting is having on local populations, as well as the species as a whole. It is recommended that a species action plan is developed linking all fisheries associated with this species in order to cease population decline and allow sustainable practices (e.g. LANCONNECT Initiative: http://www.ba.ieo.es/lanconnect).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Palinurus elephas</em> has been heavily harvested throughout its range and is generally considered to be overexploited, although long-term catch per unit effort (CPUE) data are not available for most fisheries (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). Traditionally, <em>P. elephas</em> was captured by means of baited traps until the development of new materials and hauling techniques in the 1960s led to the introduction of trammel-nets, which virtually eliminated trap fishing (Goñi <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>In the Atlantic, catch rates from the Welsh fishery showed a decline of 92% between 1980 and 1997 (Hunter 1999). A sevenfold decline in CPUE was registered in the SW Irish fishery between 1972 and 1999 (Tully 2011). In the Mediterranean, CPUE in the Corsican fishery declined by 25% between 1984 and 1999, associated with a 38% increase in effort (fewer boats but more nets fished) (Ruitort 1999). In NW Sardinia, CPUE declined by 70% between 1976 and 2001, along with a 60% increase in the number of boats. Catch rates of two Spanish Mediterranean fisheries have remained stable during the last decade at levels about eight times lower than in a population protected in a MPA (Groeneveld <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Official landing statistics of 2009 from the FAO Global Capture Production summary (FAO 2009) for Atlantic fisheries of <em>P. elephas</em> and <em>P. mauritanicus</em> combined, show a dramatic decline from 900 t in 1966 to 56 t in 2009. For the Mediterranean, the two species are reported separately. Landings of <em>P. elephas</em> peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at near 1000 t, declined to 165 t in 2000, and increased to 404 t in 2009. Unfortunately, irregular reporting by most countries, and the mistaken inclusion of <em>Palinurus mauritanicus</em> or other species (e.g. <em>Homarus gammarus</em> in Greece or <em>Panulirus regius</em> in Morocco) in some records, renders the data useless (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). Also, in fisheries where <em>P. elephas</em> is sold locally (e.g. southern Europe and Mediterranean) a potentially significant proportion of the catch may go unrecorded. A recent reconstruction of Corsican landings (1950–2008) suggested that 16 times more lobster were landed than are reflected in the data reported to the FAO (Harper and Zeller 2011). Nevertheless, a decline from 300 t in 1954 to 80 t in 2008 was still apparent.</p>  <p>A recent assessment of the Balearic, Corsican and Sardinian fisheries (LANCONNECT project; http://www.ba.ieo.es/lanconnect/) showed that fleets of 170–220 boats target <em>P. elephas</em> in each region with trammel nets during the 5 to 8-month fishing season. The estimated landings of each of these fisheries in 2009 ranged between 60 and 100 t, amounting to a total of 280–300 t, or 70% of the official FAO landings (404 t) for the entire Mediterranean in 2009. Tunisia has a reliable series of landing statistics because nearly all catches of <em>P. elephas</em> are exported for foreign consumption. Annual landings between 1990 and 2002 peaked at 74 t in 1993 and declined gradually to 33 t in 2002 (Quetglas <em>et al</em>. 2004), representing a decline of 44% in nine years.&#160; In Croatia reported annual landings were highest in 1953 and declined to 23-43 tons between 1985 – 1998, remaining stable the following decade (A. Soldo pers. comm. in Goñi and Latrouite 2005).</p>  <p>French Atlantic fisheries landed up to 1000 t in the 1950s, but only 25 t in 2010 (Laurans <em>et al</em>. 2011). Presently, <em>P. elephas</em> is considered to be a bycatch of some 100 finfish netting vessels. Irish <em>P. elephas</em> exports fluctuated from a high of 271 t in 1959 declining to current landings of around 20 t by 30 boats (Tully 2011). &#160;Portuguese stocks (mainly along the southwest coast) are also overfished with consistent declines in abundance and present landings down to 10% of those in the late 1980s and 1990s (Galhardo <em>et al</em>. 2006); annual official landings in 2006-2007 amounted to 12 t (Barrento <em>et al</em>. 2008). &#160;In combination, and despite under-reporting, the trends shown above reflect strong declines of lobster stocks in the Atlantic, where some fisheries are commercially extinct, although returning in some areas (i.e. Ireland), but also in the Mediterranean where viable fisheries operate. The cause appears to be primarily fishing mortality.</p>",Marine,yes,Invertebrate,spp_th

Exploitation began in the 1950s off the coast of northwest Africa; by the 1960s 40 boats were harvesting the lobsters using a mix of baited traps and bottom trawls (Maigret 1978). <br/><br/>In 1961, the French landings are said to have peaked at 3,600 tonnes, but quickly fell to a catch of 200 tonnes in 1970. Fishing effort was then significantly reduced, which followed with an increase in landings to 900 tonnes in 1986. In 1987, the Portugese fishing fleet was granted lobster netting rights by the European Commission; this led to an increase in poaching and the fishery collapsed once again. In 1990 the French stopped harvesting this fishery (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). Today, this species is mostly taken as by-catch of the demersal fish fisheries off Mauritania (Goñi and Latrouite 2005). This species is still targeted in the Bay of Biscay, but it has not proved economically viable as a sustained fishery owing to rapid declines in catch and few good fishing grounds (Goñi and Latrouite 2005).

These stocks detail the major lobster producing countries, although there are many other countries that also utilize this resource:  <p>Southern Stock: Brazil, Venezuela, Dominican Republic and Lesser Antilles.</p>  <p>South Central Stock: Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras and Jamaica.</p>  <p>North Central Stock: Mexico, Belize and southern Cuba.</p>  <p>Northern Stock: North Cuba, USA (Florida), Bahamas, Turks and Caicos and Bermuda.</p>      <p>Landings of this species over the last 50-60 years, have fluctuated significantly, peaking at 37,500 tonnes in 1995/1996. Both the Northern and Southern stocks have shown an increase in landings, while the South Central stock appears to have stabilized, and the North central stock has shown a decline (FAO 2006). The biggest producing countries include Cuba, the Bahamas, Brazil, Nicaragua and the USA, which in 1998 accounted for over 88% of the global landings. This species is harvested using a number of gear types including traps, gill nets, by hand (divers), and aggregating devices known as 'pesqueros' or 'casitas' (FAO 2006).</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Bahamas</span>: Stock biomass abundance (as estimated from length cohort analysis) is reported to be showing a declining trend of 33% between 1992 and 2001 when it peaked at 24 million pounds and declined to 16 million pounds. There has also been a decline in the average size of lobsters since 1991/1992 when average tail weight peaked at 7.95 oz and declined to ~7.45 in 2001/2002 (Gittens and Braynen 2002). </p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Bermuda</span>: Between the 1950s and early 1970s catches of this species fluctuated between 150 and 200 tonnes with a peak in 1968 at 250 tonnes. As of the 1970s there was a decline in catch to between 10 and 40 tonnes per annum. This decline in landings is likely a result of a conservation program started in 1975 which prohibited the removal of individuals less than 92 mm (CL); a closed fishing season between 1<sup>st</sup> April and 31<sup>st</sup> August over the breeding season; prohibition of the removal of berried females; protection of juveniles in nursery areas around the North Shore and inshore waters of the sounds and harbours (Evans and Evans 1995). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is seen as an appropriate index of abundance when studying the Bermuda population, as annual sea temperatures fluctuate very little in this region and thereby have little effect on the catchability coefficient. During the period 1975-1986 there was an overall increase in CPUE from just 0.4 lobsters trap/ haul to above 0.6 lobsters trap/ haul (Evans and Evans 1995). During the period 1996-2001 CPUE was reported as relatively stable for the offshore fishery while the inshore fishery has shown a declining trend. In 2001/2002 fishing effort was reduced; total landings were still down in this season but CPUE was significantly higher (2.29 in 2001/2002 compared to 1.70 in 2000/2001) (Trott, Luckhurst and Medley 2002).</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Belize</span>: There has been a significant decline in the CPUE in the spiny lobster fishery in this region from ~1.2 kg/trap in 1965 to 0.6 kg/trap in 1997. There are also reports that 10% of the landings consist of undersized individuals (Carcamo 2003).</p>  <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Brazil</span>: Since 1959, there has been a significant increase in the landings of this species from 1,000 tonnes to over 10,000 tonnes in the early 1990's. There has since been a subsequent decline to annual landings ranging from 6,000 to 8,000 tonnes (FISHSTAT Plus 2000). During the period 1974 to 1993 CPUE declined from ~0.30 to ~0.15 (FAO 2001), a decline of ~50%. Abundance estimates (estimated by tuned length cohort analysis) show a significant decline since 1993 from ~25 to 30 million down to around 15 million in 1997. During this period there was a number of new fishing vessels entering the fleet, as well as an increase in the use of gillnets, traps, scuba divers and free divers. However the stock abundance of this fishery is largely driven by variable levels of recruitment which are brought about by environmental changes such as ENSO events. This in combination with a growing intensity in the fishing fleet could result in ongoing declines in abundance (FAO 2001).</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Cuba</span>: There are four lobster management zones in Cuba: North Western which accounts for approximately 2% of the landings; North Eastern which accounts for approximately 15% of the landings; Gulf of Batabano which accounts for approximately 60% of the landings; South Eastern which accounts for approximately 23% of the landings (Cruz and Adriano 2001). <span lang=""""EN-GB"""">In 1953, landings of this species increased from approximately 1,000 tonnes per year to a peak of 13,578 tonnes in 1985. There has since been a subsequent decline to 4,401 tonnes in 2006. This species is of huge economic importance to Cuba and represents approximately 60% of the country's gross income from fisheries (Baisre and Cruz 1994). The particularly high landings from 1978 to 1988 was largely due to an increase in fishing effort. Cruz and Phillips (1994) found the number of pesqueros deployed on the fishery rose from 440,000 in 1975 to 856,000 in 1983 and 1,230,600 in 1987, as well as strict compliance with minimum legal size limits, and the closed fishing season (Puga <em>et al.</em> 1992). The decline in catch as of 1988 may be in part due to hurricane Gilbert which is thought to have affected lobster nursery grounds (Cruz Font 2002). Ninety percent of the lobster catch is comprised of lobsters aged 2 to 6 with 55% aged 3 to 4 (Cruz Font 2002). In the report by Cruz Font (2002) their calculations indicate that an increase in current fishing effort could result in higher catch as actual fishing mortality is lower than maximum yield, however this does not take account of the resulting effect on spawning stock biomass. The authors recommend that instead of defining a biological reference point (BRP) based on yield per recruit such as F<sub>max</sub> and F<sub>0.1</sub> , they recommend adopting a view which focuses on spawning stock or egg production in order to preserve reproductive potential (calculated as reference fishing mortality F<sub>x%</sub> representing a spawning stock biomass per recruit that is x% of that with no fishing). A BRP of 35-50%, based on spawning biomass, is recommended. </p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Jamaica</span>: There has been an ongoing increase in the landings of this species since the early 1980's. Landings then peaked at ~700 tonnes in 2005. During this time intensity of the fishing fleet has increased significantly, however CPUE data is not available due to lack of cooperation from fishers (Kelly 2002).</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Nicaragua</span>:&#160; Over the history of this fishery, effort has increased linearly. Rates of fishing mortality (<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">F</span>) have reached levels of 0.53 per year while natural mortality is calculated at 0.35 per year. Regulations include annual fishing quotas which are defined by changes in annual recruitment; prohibition of fishing during periods of maximum recruitment and egg-laying (May-June); prohibition on removal of berried females. However at present there is no effective means to monitor or control these regulations. There has also been a decline in the mean length of individuals being harvested from 163 mm in 1990/1991 to 159 mm in 2002/2003 indicating growth-overfishing. Biomass estimates were obtained by means of length cohort analysis and indicate considerable fluctuations over the period 1990 - 2002. In the season 1998/1999 abundance fell to below 3,636 tonnes, while in season 1999/2000 it exceeded 5,454 tonnes but subsequently declined to below 3,636 tonnes in 2001/2002. The decline in 1998/1999 could be related to the effect of hurricane Mitch on nursery grounds and thereby affecting recruitment (Navarro 2002).</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Puerto Rico</span>: Over the period 1988-2001, landings of this species rose from ~150,000 pounds to 250,000-300,000 pounds per year (Matos-Caraballo <em>et al.</em> 2007). During this time CPUE for each gear type has also shown an increase. Average size of individuals has increased from the period 1988-1994 to 1995-2001 perhaps as a result of good enforcement of the minimum size limit (Matos-Caraballo <em>et al.</em> 2007). </p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Florida</span>, United States of America-Since the 1970s the landings of this species have been fairly stable with some fluctuation occurring. Prior to this CPUE peaked at over 100 lbs/trap and then declined to ~10 lbs/trip in 1975. Since the fishing season of 1990/1991 the catch rate per trip has been steadily increasing from ~0.75 pounds/trip to ~1.12 pounds/trip in 1999/2000. Spawning stock biomass of females has also increased during the period 1993/1994 - 1999/2000 from ~2.5 million pounds to ~3 million pounds, while male biomass has shown some variability between ~1.8 and ~2.3 million pounds (Muller <em>et al.</em> 2000). Recruitment levels appear to be higher following the Trap Reduction Program which was implemented in 1992/1993, with numbers of age 2 lobsters rising from an average of 9.1 million lobsters, to 12.6 million lobsters (Muller <em>et al.</em> 2000). In 2000, Matthews considered the fishery to be in a stable state.</p>    <p><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Venezuela</span>: During the period 1950-1977, the landings of this species fluctuated between 100-200 tonnes per annum. Between 1977 and 1993 the landings then showed more dramatic fluctuations between 250 and 1200 tonnes per annum. This was followed by a subsequent decline to approximately 100 tonnes from 1998-2001 but has since shown an increase to approximately 1,100 tonnes. There is no formal data on fishing effort in Venezuela although sporadic reports have been made by Parque Nacional Archipiélago los Roques (PNALR). From 1994 to 1997, free divers CPUE is said to have decreased significantly (5,157 kg per diver per season to 2,966 kg per diver per season), while trap catches are thought to have increased during this same period from 80.2 kg per trap per season, to 93.2 kg per trap per season in 1996, and 90.8 kg per trap per season in 1997 (FAO 2001). At present ~95% of the landings of this species are derived from Los Roques Archipelago National Park (Yallonardo <em>et al</em>. 2001). Size frequency of lobsters taken during the period 1986-1988 and 1998-1999 did not differ significantly indicating that growth overfishing does not appear to be a problem. Mean CPUE by trapping increased from 2.29 kg/trap/month in 1986-1988, to 2.31 kg/trap/month in 1998-1999, and CPUE by diving increased from 133 kg/diver/month in 1986-1988, to 155.65 kg/diver/month in 1998-1999 (Yallonardo <em>et al.</em> 2001). While a decline in the landings was noted in the trap fishery (158,363 kg to 93,555 kg) this is likely related to a decline in the number of traps being used over this time period (275 traps to 225 traps) (Yallonardo <em>et al.</em> 2001). While the conclusion of this study implicates stability in the fishery, the authors note that only a single data point was used for the period 1986-1988.</p>",Marine,yes,Invertebrate,spp_unknown_status

However, a recent study of a similar Caribbean species, <em>Panulirus argus</em>, showed that all individuals with 6 cm CL were immature.

According to FAO catch statistics, annual global catch of Black Pomfret from 1950 to 2015 has increased steadily over time and is apparently continuing on an increasing trend (FAO FishStatJ database accessed May 2017). This species is likely over-fished in the East and South China Seas (Tao <em>et al</em>. 2012).

Kuwaiti fisheries catch an average of 150 tonnes per year of&#160;<em>Parastromateus niger</em>, which constitutes about 3% of Kuwait's annual total fish catch (Dadzie and Abou-Seedo 2008). Dadzie&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2007) determined&#160;<em>P. niger </em>was moderately exploited in Kuwaiti waters with possible room to increase catch as long as the minimum landing size is also increased. Off Kuwait, this species is caught as by-catch in trawl and gill net fisheries with average annual landings between 2000 to 2009 of 85 metric tonnes (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013). Between 2-20 kg of&#160;<em>P. niger&#160;</em>were collected as by-catch&#160;in 2010 to 2011 in&#160;Kuwait's shrimp trawl fishery, with half&#160;retained and half discarded (Chen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Between 2001-2002,&#160;<em>P. niger&#160;</em>comprised 0.38% of the total by-catch in&#160;Iranian shrimp trawl fisheries&#160;(Paighambari and Daliri 2012).&#160;It is also frequently caught as by-catch in Iranian gill net fisheries (F.

Reductions in population densities and changes in habitat use have also been noted as a result of climatic disturbance, which suggests the potential for future negative impacts from climate change (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hamilton (unpub. data) reports that night-time spear fishing in the Solomon Islands is a threat to spawning aggregations due to exceptionally high catch rates. Fishing pressure from subsistence fishing is not usually considered a major threat.<strong><em><br/></em></strong>","This species&#160;occurs in several protected areas throughout its range, including some specifically designed to protect spawning aggregations (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2005). Seasonal closures associated with spawning times are also in place in some areas (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002), but enforcement&#160;is not effective (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Size-limits and catch quotas have also been imposed in various sites in Australia. In Queensland (Australia), the catch size limits applied across all sectors of the coral reef fin fish fishery that includes commercial and recreational fishers, and charter boat operators are a minimum 38 cm total length and a total combined bag of seven individuals. The minimum size limit is designed to ensure that at least half of the fish in a population reach reproductive maturity and spawn before harvest.<br/><br/>In&#160;Palau, the Marine Protection Act of 1994 prohibits sale or purchase of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(and&#160;<em>E. polyphekadion</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>E. fuscoguttatus</em>) from April 1 through July 31 each year, with the intention to protect spawning aggregations. In 1995, the Act was amended to prohibit any capture of these groupers even for subsistence purpose in the closed period (Johannes<em> et al</em>. 1999). A four-month bul (taboo) was enforced in the state of Ngeremlengui (Fiji), but was not completely effective in preventing fishing on aggregations. Recently, the national ban was extended from 1 April to 31 October and there is a three-year ban commencing July 2015 in Ngarchelong and Kayangel State until July 2018. Export is allowed during the open season, but there is a 50 lb. limit per person for reef fish (S. Victor pers. comm. 2016). In Pohnpei (Micronesia), a&#160;sales ban is enforced during the January-May spawning season on all groupers, which includes&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). Three Pohnpei&#160;marine protected areas are in place to protect spawning aggregations for this species, but abundance declines have occurred over more than a decade for one of the three sites. No information is available for the other two sites due to the lack of monitoring (Rhodes<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2005). In Chuuk (Micronesia), a&#160;law implemented in 2015 bans grouper sales, catch and export from January to May, which is during the spawning season of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;and other known aggregating groupers (C. Graham pers. comm. 2015). In Karimunjawa National Park (Indonesia), fishers imposed a self-regulatory ban on catch of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;in 2010. As of 2011, no&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;were found in catch and sizes had increased from &lt;15 cm in 2005 to &gt;40 cm in 2010 (Yulianto<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2015). Community-based enforcement and monitoring of a marine protected area in Djual and New Ireland, Papua New Guinea resulted in the recovery of densities in aggregations (Hamilton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Hamilton<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, trap fishing is now banned.<br/><br/>Aggregation fishing should be managed or banned in the Solomon Islands, where aggregations occur in multiple and often closely spaced localities, because heavy fishing pressure is likely to rapidly deplete them (Johannes and Kile 2001). Sex and size structure in spawning aggregation should be monitored where fishing on spawning aggregations occurs.",Decreasing,"This is possibly the most abundant&#160;<em>Plectropomus</em>&#160;species in the central Western Pacific. However, there have been severe declines in certain areas, due in part to targeting of spawning aggregations by local and foreign commercial fishers driven by its high value in the international live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Vincent 2002, Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In Pacific countries, it is the most abundant and main target grouper species for the Live Reef Food Fish Trade. Although spawning can be induced in this species, it is not commercially raised in hatcheries (Tucker and Fitzgerald 1994, Y. Sadovy pers. obs.); however, juveniles are harvested from the wild for grow-out in aquaculture, which exacerbates population decline (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).<br/><br/>There appears to be intensification of fishing effort throughout the area where this species is fished for sale in the live reef fish food trade. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is a medium-valued low-volume fish with annual reported imports into Hong Kong in the hundreds of tonnes only. Sources are mainly Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, all caught in the wild. Often it is harvested from spawning aggregations and is very easy to overfish if the aggregations are targeted. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is also referred to in AFCD (Hong Kong Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department) and C&amp;SD (Census and Statistics international trade data of the Hong Kong government) databases as Spotted Coralgrouper/Trout and AFCD confirmed that these common names refer to <em>P. areolatus</em> in both databases. Fish enter Hong Kong both by air and vessel (Hong Kong live fish vessels or HKLFV). This species makes up just a small proportion of the HK-based live reef fish trade with an increasing proportion being imported by sea compared to air (Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Landings in the Philippines declined precipitously between 2015-2016 (Santos<em> et al. </em>2017). According to declining trends in trade data, large-scale population declines are likely to have occurred as a result (Y. Sadovy and K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). The amount imported to Hong Kong in 1997 was 2,319 tonnes (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999), which subsequently declined to 69 tonnes in 2006 before increasing to an average of around 150 tonnes from 2007 to 2014, an anomalous increase in imports to 458 tonnes was recorded in 2015 (possibly due to the Philippines, see Santos <em>et al.</em> 2017), but returned in 2016 to about 160 tonnes, which represents an overall decline of 93% over the past 18 years (Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2016, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the last two years,&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;has not been as common in the market in mainland China; therefore, the decline observed in Hong Kong's statistics is implied to also be occurring in mainland China as well (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;We suspect that the imports into Hong Kong are representative of a large portion of the range of this population, but there are portions of its range beyond the normal live reef fish food trade influence. For example, fish traders in Hong Kong do not import from the Indian Ocean west of the Maldives (K. Ma pers. comm. 2016). Therefore, we suspect that the actual global-level declines over the past three generation lengths (21 years) is between 30-50%. In addition, many spawning&#160;aggregations are declining somewhere in the order of&#160;60 to 100% (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2016, J. Pet pers. comm. 2016, Conservation Society of Pohnpei&#160;and A. Hughes unpub. data).<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><br/><strong style="""""""">Maldives:<em>&#160;</em></strong>In the Maldives, <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em> abundance is lower in the more heavily fished outer reef channels than in less intensely fished channels on the western side of Laamu Atoll (Sluka 2002). In 2011, an annual maximum sustainable yield of 87.41 metric tons was suggested for the entire Maldives (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). The Maldives was once a major importer of live Squaretail Coralgrouper. Between 1994 and 1996, over 500 mt of live groupers (all species combined) were exported annually. By 2007, exports were less than 100 mt. Between 2004 and 2010, exports of chilled groupers increased five-fold from around 150 mt to 550 mt, representing around 450,000 fish (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In addition, mean lengths of squaretail coralgrouper declined from over 50 cm to less than 40 cm between the 1987-1991 and 2010-2011 periods.<em><br/></em><strong style=""""""""><br/>Kiribati and other Pacific locales:&#160;</strong>The species is apparently the most abundant live reef food fish species in the Fijian Islands (Yeeting <em>et al.</em> 2001). Aggregation sites, such as Mali Passage, are no longer considered productive after protracted fishing at that site. Much of the current fishery appears to be illegal, unregulated and unmonitored and the fishery is heavily reliant on both nighttime and SCUBA spearfishing, which are known to be unsustainable fishing methods. Catch-per-unit-effort reportedly substantially&#160;declined in just 10 years. In 2015, the estimated take of groupers was in excess of 20 mt, which is considered unsustainable and greater than the volumes taken from Bua in the past when the live reef food fish trade was targeting aggregations for export&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). In Abaiang Atoll of the Gilberts Group (Kiribati), targeting of spawning aggregations had been practised in historical tradition, but pressure increased to an intense level in the 1980s during the implementation of the Outer Island Fisheries Project. The Project buys fish from the outer islands to sell in the capital city of Tarawa. During peak fishing season, daily catch of<em> P. areolatus</em> was about two tonnes (about 1,200 individuals). An underwater visual survey conducted during this same time period showed a mean density of 0.13 individuals per 100 m², with a mean individual total length of 40 cm (Yeeting unpub. data 1999). A subsequent survey in 2004 showed that mean density had declined to 0.04 individuals per 100 m², and mean total length declined to 33 cm (ProcFish 2005). Other densities (per 100 m²) and mean total length (cm) estimates are as follows: 0.19 and 37 in Abemama, Kiribati; 0.0057 and 50 in Chuuk, FSM; 0.0072 and 38 in Salelavalu, Samoa; 0.074 and 44 in Funafuti, Tuvalu; 0.081 and 37 in Nukufetau, Tuvalu (ProcFish 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Palau:&#160;</strong><em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>, along with&#160;<em>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Epinephelus polyphekedion</em>, dominate the commercial catch of groupers in Palau (Kitalong and Dalzell 1994). At least four Palau grouper spawning aggregations have disappeared since the 1970s, including one composed primarily of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>. Sites include Rebotel, Mesikm near German Channel and Uchul a Chei on the southern tip of Ngermediu reef (lost in the 1970s) (N. Idechong pers. comm. 2016). An aggregation site of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. fuscoguttatus</em>&#160;was virtually eliminated at Denges in the late 1980s by a live grouper export fishing enterprise (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999). Possibly as a result of fishing pressure, the <em>P. areolatus</em> aggregation at Ebiil has been reduced in size to only one of two sides of the channel (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999).&#160;Evidence collected in 2008-2009 from enhanced underwater visual census confirmed that aggregations of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;are confined to one side of the channel. Estimates of abundance showed aggregations with highest abundances in May-July of around 450 individuals and between 200 to 300 individuals in April and September (PCS and SCRFA 2010). Market surveys conducted in August 2010 showed substantial numbers of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;still entering the fishery prior to the sales and catch and closure, with increasing numbers marketed&#160;as the August spawning period commenced. During this period, 776 individuals were marketed (PCS and SCRFA 2010), with a mean size of 17 cm (presumably total length). Many of these individuals are assumed to be female and/or below the size at sexual maturity (Rhodes<em> et al</em>. 2013). In 1996, very limited recruitment was observed in Ebiil and Western Entrance spawning aggregations, and negligible recruitment occurred at Ngerumekaol, suggesting that the larval settlement of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;two to three years earlier may have been very low. About five to 10 times as many females as males were counted in the most lightly fished area (Western Entrance), compared to heavily fished areas (Johannes<em> et al.</em> 1999). This sex ratio may be responsible for the aggressive behaviour observed between sexes and may have prevented spawning.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Micronesia:</strong>&#160;The density of fish<em>&#160;</em>in&#160;spawning aggregations declined by 60% from 2005 to 2013 in Pohnpei (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2014), but has stabilized since its initial decline in 2005, albeit at only one-third of its 2005 densit<span style="""""""">y.</span>&#160;In 2006, a Pohnpei&#160;survey showed that&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;comprised &gt;12% of groupers targeted by the spear and line fishery and was the sixth most abundant grouper in marketed catches, with the majority of the catch composed of juveniles: 75.6% and 97.2% of marketed catch of females and males, respectively, below the mean size at sexual maturity&#160;(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). By 2015, the species ascended to the second most abundant grouper observed in marketed catch, representing 19% of the grouper fishery (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). Eighty-one percent of marketed&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;were above the 50% size at sexual maturity for females. Consistent declines in aggregation abundance have been documented within the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary, with a 69% decline in density observed between 2001 and 2013 and the notable disappearance of individuals along the shallow-water transect over this time-frame (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2014). In 2013, average densities in the aggregation were eight individuals per 100 m². Local commercial fishers are also responsible for targeting spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways, resulting in reduced abundances following heavy fishing (Rhodes and Tupper 2008, Johannes <em>et al</em>. 1999, Hamilton and Kama 2004). Protracted fishing in the absence of effective enforcement has resulted in a 69% decline in mean density at one aggregation site in Pohnpei, with notable&#160;changes in depth distribution (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2014). Obvious changes in percent contribution to marketed catch and size distribution were observed during a 10-year follow-up market survey in 2015, with an increase in contribution from 12% to 19% over 10 years (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).&#160;In Chuuk, Micronesia, the absence of gravid females in market samples suggests that spawning aggregations are not a major target for this fishery (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). A 12-month Chuuk&#160;market study,&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;was the third in abundance among all species sampled from the catch, and contributed 15.4% to the total mixed-gear fishery, with 49% of captured individuals immature&#160;(J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).&#160;During recent underwater visual surveys, the species was recorded at only two of four Pacific Island countries: Pohnpei and Yap, and was not recorded in Guam and Kosrae. Densities in Pohnpei were 1.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>, 0.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>&#160;on Ifalik Atoll, and 0.43 individuals/ha<sup>-1&#160;</sup>at Satawal Atoll&#160;(B.

A five-year monitoring program conducted from 1995-2000 at two spawning aggregation sites within the park, recorded that the mean length of individuals decreased by 8 cm and fish numbers at aggregations were low, at less than 100 per aggregation site and period (Pet <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enforcement and monitoring lapses in this park resulted in the apparent extirpation&#160;of at least one aggregation site and significant declines in others (Mangubhai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;At Ayau, Raja Ampat, approximately 300 individuals were observed in a spawning aggregation that formed in areas of high coral cover on the southeast corner of the island (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;After the implementation of stricter rules governing marine protected areas in Aceh, individuals of this species increased in length from 16 to 35 cm by 2009, and some observed were greater than 40 cm in 2010 (Yulianto <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Hamilton and Smith (2005) reported that two to three Manus fishers (Papua New Guinea) can remove an estimated 100 individuals per night from spawning sites using night-time spearfishing techniques; as a result of this heavy pressure, abundance and catch declines have occurred (Hamilton 2003). Marovo (Solomon Islands) fishermen state that the average aggregation&#160;size of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;has been declining since spearfishing became widely practised in the area. Increasing human population in the Western Solomon Islands (doubling about every 17 years) is also exerting pressure on the species.&#160;In Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, 24-hour daily fishing operations between 1996 and 1997 removed an estimated three to four tonnes of grouper species per trip, including&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(Hamilton and Kama 2004). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) records from Roviana Lagoon estimate a catch rate of 16.8 kg/hr per fisher during the course of 41 fishing trips (Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2005). At least one Roviana&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em> aggregation has been fished to economic extinction (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2005). In addition, destructive fishing practices associated with this fishery significantly damaged coral reef habitat within the aggregation site (K. Rhodes pers. obs.). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, the live reef food fish trade has operated sporadically during the past decade and spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways are systematically targeted; as a result,&#160;declines in abundance have frequently been severe. Community-based monitoring and enforcement has resulted in improvements in aggregation abundance and density inside protected areas at Djual, New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, with a 37-fold difference in mean densities being detected between areas inside protected areas (7.34 individuals/1,000 m²) versus outside (0.2 individuals/1,000 m²) (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2016).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Australia:<em>&#160;</em></strong>The only known statistics on the&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;fishery come from the Torres Strait where it is lumped with other live reef fish.

Further protections of spawning aggregations from fishing pressure are recommended (Elamin 2012).",Decreasing,"This species is rare to uncommon along the eastern Red Sea coast, but it is naturally relatively abundant on the west coast (e.g., Sudan). Its density during underwater surveys conducted in central&#160;Saudi Arabia was 0.47 individuals&#160;per 1,000 m² as compared to 2.91 individuals per 1,000 m² in Sudan (R. Cole pers. comm). Differences in abundance appear to be habitat related, although, it also may be attributed to fishing pressure occurring on coastal reefs of Sudan (M. Berumen pers. comm). However, underwater surveys conducted along the coast of Sudan in 2007 recorded very low numbers of this species, with zero sightings at 24 out of 36 sites (Equipe Cousteau 2008). Extensive underwater surveys conducted in 2014 did not record it from Djibouti, Socotra or western Oman (H. Choat and M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2018).&#160;An underwater survey conducted off Egypt in the Red Sea at seven sites between 3-10 metres depth from 2001 to 2003,&#160;did not observe this species (Leujak 2006). According to underwater surveys conducted in 2013, it appears to be virtually absent from the Gulf of Aqaba (H. Choat pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>According to fisher interviews, declines have occurred in some areas. It is virtually absent from Eritrea, which may be due to heavy fishing there. In Saudi Arabia, catch of this species is highest in the northern and central areas, particularly by the handline fishery (79.6% of production) with gill nets and traps representing about 1% of the catch. This is the most abundant epinephelid species in the Jeddah market. Official fisheries statistics reported by Saudi Arabia from 1995-2002 show that catch and catch per unit effort of this species in the handline fishery was stable over time with an annual average of 304 tonnes, which represented 2.3% of total catch of fish in Saudi Arabia (Red Sea only; Fallatah 2005). However,&#160;there has been a&#160;gradual catch decline in northern and central areas and an increase in southern areas of Saudi Arabia; although, in the southern area, this species is frequently confused with <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>, so catches may be mis-reported there. A spawning season fishing closure during 1994-2001&#160;reduced effort and catch&#160;(Fallatah 2005). Its current status in Saudi Arabia is not known. In Sudan, this species has been heavily targeted, especially during spawning aggregation season, since at least the mid-1990s; as a result, it is considered overfished. In addition, immature individuals comprise a significant portion of the catch, which is contributing to growth overfishing (Elamin 2012).&#160;Estimated landings of&#160;<em>Plectropomus areolatus </em>and <em>P. marisrubri</em>&#160;in the Sudanese fishery declined by 50-60% from 80 tonnes in 1999 to 40 t in 2010. Overall, this species is estimated to have undergone global-level declines of at least 30%, or possibly more, since 1995, which is a time period covering the past two generation lengths (24 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (12 years) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The numbers of fishing boats involved rose rapidly and there was concern by both biologists and fishermen that the fishery might not be sustainable (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999). In general, large fish species that are slow to grow and mature are often poorly equipped to withstand intensive fishing. Although there was no obvious decrease in the length-frequency distributions of wreckfish caught off the US from 1989 to 1997 that would indicate stock declines, this may partly be due to the life-history of the animal. Juveniles are pelagic up to a large size (60 cm) before they descend and become demersal so it may be a number of years before fishing pressure would be reflected in decreasing fish sizes and by then it might be too late to initiate a management plan (Sedberry <em>et al</em>. 1999). Current management in the USA assumes that the wreckfish stocks on the US fishing ground will not be affected by fishing elsewhere, but as the source of the pelagic juveniles is not known, this may not be true (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999). European fish hooks are frequently found in fish caught from US waters. This would seem to indicate the migration of large wreckfish across great distances (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999). Finally, thousands of pelagic juveniles are being caught by pelagic tuna drift-net fisheries in the northern Atlantic (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999) which may affect fisheries of adults in the future. <br/> <br/>The case of Bermuda, where catches dropped rapidly after only being sustained for two years seems to show that high levels of fishing pressure (through use of bottom longlines in the case of Bermuda) can cause commercial extinctions of wreckfish, at least in island habitats (Sedberry <em>et al</em>. 1999). <br/> <br/>The following data on wreckfish fisheries exist in the literature. Declines in landings and CPUE are assumed to reflect declines in wreckfish stocks unless it is known that fishing effort has decreased or other factors are involved. <br/> <br/>1) The wreckfish fishery has existed in Brazil since 1973. The number of vessels involved increased from 10 in the 1970s to more than 35 in 1997 and there were technological advances in the gears used. The only estimated annual landings data available are 2,772 t (1989), 2,150 mt (1990), 1,674 t (1991), 2,291 t (1994) and 1,080 t (1995). CPUE declined 90% (0.72 to 0.073 kg/day/hook) off Southern Brazil from 1989/91 to 1997/98 (all data from Peres 2000). This fishery targets spawning aggregations thus increasing the susceptibility of the animal to overfishing. <br/> <br/>2) Following a maximum Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of 2 million pounds annually, imposed by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council in 1990/91, the estimated catch from the USA showed a relatively steady decline from 1,270,557 pounds (38,205 fish) in 1992 to 157,299 pounds (4,958 fish) in 2000 (Sedberry <em>et al</em>. 1999, Vaughan 2001). This is a drop of 87%. This is believed to be due to a decrease in fishing effort (Sedberry pers. comm. 2001) as the number of boats targeting wreckfish has declined (from 46 in 1992 to 3 in 2000, a drop of 93%) while the catch per hour has not (Hardy 2001) and the mean lengths of caught fish have not declined (Vaughan 2001). Fishing for wreckfish off the USA requires considerable skill and only the most dedicated fishers have remained. Wreckfish stocks seem large enough to maintain the current fishery (Sedberry <em>et al</em>. 1999). <br/> <br/>3) A small wreckfish fishery off Bermuda developed rapidly from 1979 (25 fish) to 1981 (369 fish) and 1982 (311) fish. Catches declined sharply from 1982 (311 fish weighed roughly 4.7 mt) to 1983 (1.2 mt) and remained below 1.5 mt over the 13 years. In 1996 and 1997, just 6 and 9 fish were caught. The decline in landings from 1981 to 1996 (roughly 5.1 mt to 0.2 t) is a drop of 96% (all data from Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999). Rapid declines were associated with the introduction of longlines into what had been a vertical line fishery. <br/> <br/>4) Annual landings of wreckfish from the Azores (off Portugal) climbed slowly from around 50-100 mt in the 1970s and 1980s to a peak of 425 mt 1994. In 1995 the catch dropped rapidly to 246 mt and was down to 139 mt by 1998. As the wreckfish is an incidental catch for a mixed-species demersal fishery which has continued to produce increased landings, it seems the decline is a reflection of decreasing wreckfish stocks. The decline from 1994 to 1998 was 67% (data from Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999, ICES Marine Data Centre 2001). <br/> <br/>5) In Madeira (off Portugal) the wreckfish fishery developed slowly with landings rising from 5 metric tonnes in 1988 to a peak 55 mt in 1994. Landings then dropped 51% to around 27 mt in 1996. This was at least partly due to a drop in the number of fishing trips (by around 45%) but as the catch per trip also dropped (by around 15%) there may have been an actual drop in wreckfish stocks. For this location the reduction in wreckfish stocks is assumed to be 15%. <br/> <br/>6) Annual landings data are also available for Northeast Portuguese waters (FAO Area 27). As Area 27 includes the Azores, ICES landings data, which lists the Azores landings separately was subtracted from Area 27 landings data to give figures for Northeast Portuguese waters (except the Azores). Annual landings here rose from 58 mt in 1986 to 283 mt in 1989, peaked at 406 and 373 mt in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and declined steadily to 165 mt in 1998 (FAO Fisheries Statistics, Capture Production 1998, ICES Marine Data Centre, 2001). The decline between 1994 and 1998 was 59%. <br/> <br/>7) In Europe, only Portugal and Spain have reported significant (i.e., 50 metric tons per year) catches of wreckfish in recent decades. Annual landings for Spain in FAO Area 27 remained below 50 mt from 1984 to 1995, rising to 115 mt in 1996 and 265 and 250 mt in 1997 and 1998 respectively (FAO Fisheries Statistics, Capture Production 1998). No further information on this fishery could be located, including whether these levels of exploitation are sustainable. <br/> <br/>8) Angola's annual landings of wreckfish stayed below 15 metric tons from 1984-1993. Landings rose sharply thereafter, from 66 mt in 1994 to 235 mt in 1995 and 1,002 and 1,326 mt in 1995 and 1997 respectively (FAO Fisheries Statistics, Capture Production 1998). No further information on this fishery could be located, including whether these levels of exploitation are sustainable. See note on systematics above regarding the taxonomic status of <em>Polyprion americanus</em> in southern Africa.  Landings in South Africa include <em>Polyprion oxegenios</em> (some from South Atlantic seamounts and islands) and a species referred to as <em>Polyprion americanus</em> (P. Heemstra pers. comm. to G. Sedberry). <br/> <br/>9) In New Zealand, catch data for <em>Polyprion americanus</em> and <em>Polyprion oxygeneios</em> (hapuku) are lumped together.  Wreckfish have been caught in relatively small quantities by the early Maori, and then by European settlers from the mid 19th century. The first decades of the commercial fishery for both species of <em>Polyprion</em> are undocumented, but it was well developed with a combined catch of over 1,500 mt by the 1930s  (Paul 2000). Management of both <em>Polyprion</em> species (together) is by Quota Management System, introduced in 1986, involving Total Allowable Catches (2,179-2,181 mt annually, 1996-2000). Landings of wreckfish alone for the 1990s are estimated to be in the region of 200-400 mt. (L. Paul, pers. comm., 2001). Only a few fishers specifically target the two species although many fishers have small quotas to cover wreckfish caught incidentally in many fisheries targeting other species (L. Paul, pers. comm., 2001). Stocks are probably overfished, but there has been very little fisheries research carried out to verify the nature of this (C. Roberts, pers. comm. 2000). <br/> <br/>10) Both wreckfish (known in Australia as Bass grouper) and Hapuku (<em>Polyprion oxygeneios</em>) are taken in the blue eye (<em>Hyperoglyphe antartica</em>) fishery off south east Australia. Records of commercial catches since the mid-1980s indicate that catches of Hapuku and Bass grouper in this fishery, which are recorded together, are low, between 10 and 40 t a year, Hapuku being by far the major species. There is no indication as to whether numbers of wreckfish are stable or in decline although some research has recently been initiated which should provide some answers in the future (Pascale Baelde, pers. comm. April 2001). <br/> <br/>In summary, fisheries specifically targeting wreckfish have only developed since the 1970s, apparently because of the technological advances in fishing needed to target a large animal living in deep waters. Where fisheries have suddenly targeted wreckfish specifically (Brazil, Bermuda, Portugal), the fishery has reached a peak and then gone into decline within a few years (","The wreckfish is only known to receive any protection, in the form of fishing restrictions, in the USA and New Zealand
<br/>
<br/>In the USA, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council put fishing regulations into place in 1990 and 1991. These cover the area between 3-200 miles off the coasts of North and South Carolina, and East Florida (the area bounded by 30 and 33º N latitude). Commercial fishers must have a wreckfish permit and Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) shares to fish. There is no recreational fishery in the USA. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of wreckfish by ITQ holders is 2 million pounds (907 metric tonnes) per year. There is a spawning season closure from Jan 15 to April 15. In addition, longlines may not be used (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999).
<br/>
<br/>There is a TAC limit for the commercial fishery in New Zealand of 2,181 metric tons for <em>Polyprion americanus</em> and <em>Polyprion oxygeneios</em> (hapuku) together. There are also some complex bag limits for the much smaller recreational fishery.",Unknown,"It is not possible to estimate population size at present. A minimum figure could be reasonably derived by estimating numbers of fish from 1998 landings data for all countries for which is this data are available and using this figure but stating a sensible maximum figure is not possible as good data on wreckfish stocks is not available for many localities within the known range of the wreckfish. It also seems likely, as the species lives so deep, that there are also stocks yet to be discovered. It may be possible to make a crude approximation by working out the area of potential habitat based on bathymetry and the known range of the animal and multiplying this by population estimates from the better studied fishing grounds. However, calculating the area of potentially inhabitable areas will be extremely time consuming without the aid of a GIS or similar system.
<br/>
<br/>Data from the US fishery (1985-97), Brazilian fishery (1989 to 98 with some missing years), and Portuguese and Spanish fisheries (1984-1998) shows no fluctuations above or approaching order of magnitude that cannot be explained by known fishing effort (data from FAO Fisheries Statistics, Capture Production 1998, Sedberry <em>et al</em>. 1999, Peres 2000).  Large annual fluctuations would be unusual for an animal as long-lived and slow to reach sexual maturity as the wreckfish.
<br/>
<br/>Evidence from mtDNA indicates that the subpopulation in the north Atlantic is probably isolated from that in the southern hemisphere (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1996). There may also be a subpopulation within the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 1999). Subsequent genetic work using microsatellites has revealed that within the southern hemispheres, there are clear differences between the Brazilian and South Pacific subpopulations (Ball <em>et al</em>. 2000). Temperature profiles and current patterns are believed to prevent significant gene flow between these three subpopulations.
<br/>
<br/>It seems extremely likely, given the continued and recent increases in exploitation, that the population of wreckfish will continue to decline in the near future, and that freshly discovered stocks will decline rapidly, if fishing is not controlled.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_unknown_status

Listed as one of the 5 most abundant fish species in underwater surveys of mostly rocky areas across the Canaries with the highest count of any species on one of the transects (Hajagos and Van Tassell (2001).  This is a fast-growing short-lived species (Pajuelo et al 2003).     A survey of the fisheries of the Canary Islands found that this species was in danger of recruitment-overfishing, as 45% of the individuals caught are below the breeding size (Pajuelo <em>et al.</em> 2003).  In the Canary Islands an 80% reduction in non-exploited equilibrium rates are inferred from a growth-overfishing model.

It forms predictable congregations of spawning and post-spawning adults, which increases its susceptibility to rapid depletion by heavy fishing activity (Govender 1996, Hoyle <em>et al</em>. 2000, Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012). While it is explicitly targeted by recreational or commercial fisheries in many parts of its range, it is also taken as incidental catch as part of nearshore multi-species fisheries, particularly those targeting small pelagics (Martín <em>et al</em>. 2008). Off Senegal, juveniles and adults are heavily targeted by purse-seine and recruitment overfishing is likely occurring.","Subpopulations of this species are subject to varying degrees of fisheries management throughout its range. In 2014, this species was regionally assessed as Near Threatened in the Europe region due to overexploitation and regionally assessed as Least Concern in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015 due to no significant decline.<br/>&#160;<br/>The use of seasonal area closures in South Africa (Govender 1996, Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012) and Australia (Zeller <em>et al</em>. 1996, Ward <em>et al</em>. 2003) is thought to protect spawning adult <em>P. saltatrix</em> from such selective fishing pressures (Bealey 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>United States</em></strong><br/>The Atlantic coast stock is jointly managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. A total annual quota is established and allocations are given to commercial and recreational fisheries (Wood 2013). Regulations also include permits and limits on size and bag (Shepard 2006, NMFS 2012). A rebuilding plan established in 2001 has allowed this subpopulation to increase (Wood 2013) and action is under way to improve uncertainty in some of the data utilized for the stock assessment.<br/><br/><strong><em>Brazil</em></strong><br/>Despite economic importance and indications of significant decline, Brazilian bluefish fisheries are data-poor and not formally managed. Suggested conservation measures include reduction of fishing effort by purse seines and limiting the capture of juveniles (Silvano and Begossi 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Atlantic/Mediterranean</strong></em><br/>This species does not appear to be managed in the western Mediterranean. Regulations such as minimum mesh sizes, size limits, and gear restrictions are in place in parts of the eastern Mediterranean. However, in the case of Turkey where the majority of landings are taken, these regulations are not adhered to (Ulman 2005). According to Cengiz et al. (2013), growth overfishing in the Turkey population will continue unless gear restrictions and minimum size limits are implemented and enforced.<br/><br/><strong><em>Eastern Central Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Other than the collection of catch data, this species is not managed in the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, efforts to control fishing effort are the principal tool of management, and are applied indirectly through licensing. Legislation prohibits trawling within 12 miles of the Mauritanian coast. Additionally, pelagic trawlers and purse seines are prohibited from utilizing nets with a mesh-size less than 40 mm.<br/><br/><em><strong>Angola and South Africa</strong></em><br/>Off Angola, management of this fishery is inadequate. Fisheries management policies in Angola favour development and there is little accuracy in monitoring. Off South Africa, there is an annual closed season for this species from 1 October to 30 November as well as a minimum capture size of 30 cm and a 4-fish bag limit (Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Republic of South Africa 2014). Commercial exploitation is prohibited in the KwaZulu-Natal (Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012). Despite revision of management protocols in 2005, no improvement in catch rates were detected. Poor angler compliance and lack of regulation knowledge indicate that alternate management measures are needed. Recommendations include the establishment of a marine protected area network (Dunlop and Mann 2012). A nation-wide stock assessment for this species is urgently needed (Maggs and Mann 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>Australia</em></strong><br/>In Australia, recreational fishery regulations have included minimum legal sizes (typically between 23-35 cm TL), quotas, and temporal closures to coincide with spawning aggregations (Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several assumptions about stock structure need to be clarified through improved data collection when developing future stock assessments (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).<span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""></span><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><span class=""""apple-converted-space""""><p></p></span>",Decreasing,"<strong><em>Population structure</em><br/></strong>This seasonal migratory species is found in about 8–10 geographically isolated subpopulations (Briggs 1960, Goodbred and Graves 1996); northeastern Atlantic (U.S. east coast), southwestern Atlantic (southern Brazil), Mediterranean (Turkey), northwestern Africa, southern Africa (Angola and South Africa), northern Indian (Somalia, Oman, India), and Australia (western and eastern). Despite its larval capacity for long-distance dispersal, gene flow between subpopulations is severely limited (Goodbred and Graves 1996). Recent study indicates that western and eastern Atlantic populations appear to be isolated (Pardiñas <em>et al</em>. 2010). Very little information is available on its subpopulations in the northern Indian Ocean portion of its range.<br/><strong><br/><em><span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"""">Global&#160;</span></em><span style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""""><em>FAO landings statistics summary</em></span></strong><strong style=""""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""""><br/></strong>The following Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) fishing regions reported landings in 2011: Eastern Central Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Atlantic, Western Central Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Pacific, Southwest Pacific.&#160;The period of three generation lengths is estimated at 15-24 years. <u>Overall global landings declined by 7-46% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(calculated using the endpoints of the data) (FAO 2013)</u><u>.</u> The largest fisheries occur&#160;in the southwestern Atlantic (Brazil), the western Atlantic along the&#160;eastern USA, the southern Mediterranean along Africa, southern Africa, and eastern Australia.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic</strong></em><br/><u>U.S. Atlantic</u><br/>Along the U.S. Atlantic, this species is managed as a single, migratory stock distributed from Maine to eastern Florida. This management regime/unit stock hypothesis is supported by genetic data (Graves   <em>et al</em>. 1992, Goodbred and Graves 1996, Davidson 2002, Wood 2013). It is&#160;abundant and widespread along the eastern U.S. (Kendall and Walford 1979) and supports a significant recreational fishery and a smaller commercial fishery in the U.S. (Rodger and Zharen 2012). Concerns surrounding population decline caused fishery managers to implement a rebuilding plan for the stock in 2001, and as a result of these measures, the population gradually increased and was determined to have been rebuilt by 2007.&#160;Historically, total stock biomass estimates peaked in 1982, then declined by 77% by 1996 before increasing by 64% to 2010 and slightly declining again by 4% in 2012&#160;(Wood 2013).&#160;Fishing mortality steadily declined between 1987 to 1999 and has remained steady since 2000.&#160;The most recent stock assessment update for the Atlantic coast indicated it was&#160;not overfished, nor experiencing overfishing (Wood 2014). <u>Estimated total abundance</u><u>&#160;declined by 13-34% over the past 15-24 years&#160;</u><u>(1999-2013 and 1990-2013)</u><u>, estimated total biomass declined by 7% over the past 24 years and increased by 31% over the past 15 years, and estimated spawning stock biomass increased by 16-27%&#160;</u><u>&#160;over the past 15-24 years&#160;</u><u>(calculated using the endpoints of the data) (Wood 2014; pages 24-25 Tables 10 and 11).</u>&#160;Estimated recruitment has remained relatively constant since 2002, but dropped to an all time low in 2012 (Wood 2013). Recruitment increased in 2013 and it is now thought that low estimates in recent years can be attributed to a biased model (Wood 2014). Models indicate that biomass may continue to decline into the future under current fishing pressure if poor recruitment continues. In addition, changes in fishery-independent survey methods as well as limited age information and lack of data on discard size have contributed to uncertainty in the stock assessment (Wood 2013). In response, a coast-wide sampling program was established&#160;in 2012 to improve the data used in future stock assessments.<br/><br/><u>Gulf of Mexico</u><br/>This species is landed incidentally in fisheries targeting other coastal migrants (<em>Scomberomorus</em> spp., <em>Rachycentron canadum</em>). Due to minimal catch levels, it is not managed within the Coastal Migratory Pelagics Fishery Management Plan of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (as of 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, commercial landings over the past 25 years (1990-2012) declined from about 230 mt in 1990 to 30 mt in 1998, and then increased again to about 110 mt in 2012. By comparison, commercial landings in 2012 in the Atlantic stock was 2,236 mt (Wood 2014), which is 20 times greater than in the Gulf of Mexico. There are no catch statistics for Mexico. This species has a smaller body size in the Gulf of Mexico compared to individuals in the Atlantic population (Barger 1990).<br/><br/><u>Southwestern Atlantic</u><br/>This species is widely distributed off eastern South America, but is more abundant south of Rio de Janeiro (23S). Individuals off southern Brazil are smaller than those along the U.S. Atlantic and northeastern Africa (Haimovici and Krug 1996). This species is considered relatively abundant from southern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) to northern Argentina where it comprises a single stock and is fished with purse-seines and gill-nets (Juanes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). Landings from Rio de Janeiro to Argentina averaged about 5000 t from 1970 to 1992 and peaked at 15,000 t in 1971. Most landings occurred in Brazil (88.5%), followed by Argentina (11.4%) and Uruguay (0.1%). Within Brazil, the majority of landings occur in the waters off Rio de Janeiro and Brazilian fisheries are data-poor in general (Silvano and Begossi 2010). The purse-seine fishery is largely sustained by individuals age 1-3 years (age at first maturity is 2-3 years), with age-1 fish representing 53.2% of the total number and 35.2% of the total weight. Between 1976 and 1983, over 99% of the catches were of individuals aged 1 to 4 years; as such, this fishery is likely at a high risk for recruitment overfishing. <u>Off Rio de Janeiro, estimated catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) declined by 54% over the past 17 years (1992-2008) (</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data) (Bender <em>et al.</em> 2014 supplemental data)</u><u>.</u> Fishers interviewed about observed trends in bluefish landings&#160;corroborated the observed decline in CPUE. Results of the interviews indicated that the amount caught by line fishers declined by 70% over the past 50 years (1960-2010) and in the beach seine fishery by 80% over the past 60 years (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><u>Eastern Central Atlantic</u><br/>Landings are recorded by northern CECAF (Fishery Committee of the Eastern Central Atlantic), a fishing region defined within the bluefish range as Morocco to Gambia, including the Canaries and Madeira Islands and Cape Verde Islands. Landings peaked in the 1970s and have generally declined since then (FAO 2013). There was a severe decline in landings from 1970 (peak of 19000 tonnes) to 1986 (less than 2,000 tonnes), and has since been fluctuating around 4,000-5,000 metric tonnes over the past 20 years.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 52-61% over the past 15-24 years (</u><u>1999-2013 and&#160;</u><u>1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(CECAF via FAO FishstatJ 2013).&#160;</u>A data series in the Improve Scientific and Technical Advice for Fisheries Management (ISTAM) project database (1962-1999) reveals fluctuations in mean weight until 1988, when mean weight averaged 2.6 kg, followed by a period of decline to an average weight of 1.1 kg in 1999 (ISTAM database, Camar unpublished data 2013). This species was formerly considered common off Senegal, but recently, only juveniles are occasionally seen (S. Mor pers. comm. 2012) and it is now considered commercially extinct (Belhabib<em> et al.</em> 2014). It may be retained in purse-seine fisheries targeting small pelagics (i.e. clupeoids) as it is in some Mediterranean fisheries, but this is not quantified nor confirmed.&#160;<br/><br/><u>Mediterranean<br/></u>Genetic evidence indicates there is regional population structuring between the eastern and western Mediterranean (Pardiñas 2010).&#160;Landings data imply that&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>&#160;is most abundant in the eastern Mediterranean and has only recently begun being fished in the western Mediterranean. It occurs as&#160;by-catch in the&#160;anchovy and sardine&#160;purse-seine fishery off&#160;the Catalan Coast&#160;(Martín&#160;<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008).&#160;Patterns of morphological differentiation suggest the existence of three distinct groups in the Mediterranean and Black Seas: the eastern Black Sea, the western Black Sea/Marmara Sea/Aegean Sea, and the northeastern Mediterranean (Turan&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006). In the past, this species was primarily taken as bycatch with smaller schooling clupeoid species, but is now directly targeted via commercial purse seine (Dhieb <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Landings in the western Mediterranean increased from &lt;50 tonnes prior to 1996 to a peak of 200 tonnes in 2010, possibly reflecting the increased abundance and northward expansion of this species in the western Mediterranean in response to warming sea temperatures in the region (Sabatés<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2012). <u>Overall regional landings declined by 33% over the past 24 years (1990-2013) and increased by 49% over the past 15 years (1999-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).&#160;</u>Overfishing of larger species such as the bluefish occurred in the 1960-70s and reconstructed catches indicate that it has been declining since around 1980 (Ulman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The largest commercial bluefish<em>&#160;</em>fishery in the Mediterranean is located in Turkey, and is among the most frequently landed species in the recreational fishery in the Ankakale Strait (also Turkey) (Ünal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<u>Reconstructed total bluefish landings off Turkey declined by 32% over the past 24 years (1987-2010) and increased by 7% over the past 15 years&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(Ulman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013; Table 5 page 339).&#160;</u>The&#160;mean length of individuals caught in Turkey&#160;decreased by 44% between 1959 to 2004 (45 years) and fishing mortality is too high (Akyol and Ceyhan 2007, Cengiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;Catch from the Black Sea increased until the late 1980s, and has since declined (Keskin 2012). The primary gear used is purse seine, which exerts heavy fishing pressure on young, migrating individuals. In the past, the bluefish&#160;entered the Black Sea seasonally, but is now rarely present due stock depletion in the region (Lleonart 2008).&#160;Off Tunisia, this species is exploited by artisanal fishers and commercial purse seiners and is also experiencing growth overfishing in this area (Dhieb <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).<br/><br/><u>Northeast Atlantic and Azores</u><br/>In the Azores, it is targeted in the pole-and-line coastal pelagic fishery from June to October&#160;(Pinho<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Landings in the Northeast Atlantic FAO fishing zone are declared by Spain and Portugal. Overall landings peaked in 1997 at 1,914 tonnes and subsequently declined by 97% to 59 tonnes by 2000 and has been stable around that level ever since.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 77-87% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).</u>&#160;In the Gulf of Cadiz, landings fluctuated&#160;between 2001 to 2009 with a slight overall declining trend. <u>According to data collected by the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) in the Gulf of Cadiz, biomass&#160;(g/haul) declined by about 80%&#160;and CPUE (number/haul) by 50% over the past 17 years (1997-2013) (J. Gil Herrera pers. comm., IBTS Trawl Survey Data).<br/></u><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>Southern Africa</em><br/></strong><u>Southeastern Atlantic - Angola<br/></u>In the southeastern Atlantic, this species&#160;is heavily targeted off southern Angola by the growing industrial, artisanal, subsistence and recreational sectors (especially after a civil war that ended in 2002). This increase in fishing pressure has had negative impacts on marine resources in the area, including&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>. Truncation of age (26% reduction in maximum age) and length (11% reduction in max length), and reduction of female dominance between study periods reflects the selective removal of large, old individuals. This&#160;is likely to have negative consequences for its reproductive success. Fisheries management policies are considered insufficient and ineffective.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 64-99% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).</u>&#160;The Angola population appears to be isolated from the South African population (Maggs <em>et al.</em> 2012); it is less common between northern Namibia and Cape Point, South Africa except within Saldanha Bay (Maggs and Mann 2013).&#160;<br/><br/><em><strong>Western Indian Ocean </strong></em><br/>Recent surveys have suggested a bi-polar distribution of&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>&#160;in the Western Indian Ocean. It has been found off Puntland in Somalia and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, but not between these latitudes (van der Elst<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004). There is currently no information about this species in the northwestern Indian Ocean. Reported landings of this species to the FAO from the western Indian Ocean zone have been very few since records first began in 1950; however, it is known that its population off Oman is exploited (Chesalin <em>et al.</em> 2012). This species undertakes annual northward migrations from the southeastern coast of South Africa, and reaches the waters of KwaZulu-Natal to spawn in late spring (van der Elst 1976). It is&#160;heavily fished by shore anglers along the KwaZulu-Natal coast (Beckley and Connell 1996) and is caught by subsistence fishers in the eastern and western Cape (Maggs and Mann 2013). CPUE declined by 60% between 1956-1973, but varied from year to year (van der Elst 1976). A 1997 assessment considered the stock to be overexploited (Govender 1997).&#160;<u>Overall South Africa landings reported to FAO declined by 82-89% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).&#160;</u><u>As recorded by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife shore patrols, CPUE declined by about 80% between 1985-2009 (25 years); however, there is considerable uncertainty that this is an accurate representation of its overall population status as it excludes data from offshore areas (Maggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).</u>&#160;Despite management intervention, which included the revision of management protocols in 2005, no improvement in catch rates were detected between 2005-2012. <br/><strong><br/></strong><em><strong>Australia</strong></em><br/>Australia has two genetically distinct exploited populations, one on the east coast in New South Wales and southern&#160;Queensland, and one on the west coast (Leigh and O'Neill 2004). Total catches along western Australia are low and it is thought that the population is comparatively small. This species&#160;is heavily exploited by both the recreational and commercial sectors off&#160;Queensland-New South Wales, eastern Australia and over 80% of fish available to the fishery have been regularly harvested. Biomass is estimated at about 40% of unexploited levels (60% decline in biomass) and is about half the level seen in the 1970s. Fishing pressure has caused a decrease in body length over the history of the fishery and very few fish older than age three remain in the population. <u>In eastern Australia, standardized catch rates declined by 50% from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s (roughly three generation lengths), and the proportion of unexploited biomass dropped by 55% to 68%, depending on the degree of increase in recreational fishing pressure incorporated into the model (Leigh and O'Neill 2004).</u><br/><br/>Commercial and recreational fisheries are spatially segregated in western Australia; commercial fisheries are mostly in the Gascoyne Coast Bioregion (GCB), while recreational fisheries are primarily in the West Coast Bioregion (WCB). Although previously managed separately, evidence suggests that a single stock extends across both bioregions. It has been assumed by Smith <em>et al.</em> (2013) that the majority of the spawning stock is located in the GCB. The status of the&#160;western Australia population was assessed by the Department of Fisheries, Western Australia in 2013. Anecdotal evidence suggests a substantial decline in WCB recreational catch rates during the 1980s and 1990s; however, recent data indicate improvement in the stock's status, which may have been due to changes in fishing regulations that occurred between 1990-2009. Catch rates in the commercial fishery suggest that abundance in the GCB declined after 2000, but is still high compared to historical levels&#160;(i.e. pre-1990).&#160;Catch rates in the GCB suggest that current spawning stock biomass is relatively high and recruitment in the WCB has been increasing since 2004. These indicators suggest that there is currently a low risk for overfishing; however, this is based on several assumptions on stock structure that should be verified to improve future stock assessments (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>Overall Global Population Status</em><br/></strong>Given that each subpopulation appears to be isolated from each other and it is unknown whether one contributes a higher proportion to the overall global population or not, the declines were straight averaged equally across all subpopulations. This included zero place-holders for those areas where the population is stable (Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia).&#160;The overall (global) averaged minimum and maximum estimates for decline ranged from 39-53% over the past three generation lengths (15-24 years). We chose a range of values for the time series due to the uncertainty associated with generation length as well as the varied nature of the data types available from each individual area.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

However, a 20% decrease was evident in the North Pacific between the periods 1971-1982 to 1983-1993 (Nakano 1996). No consistent decline in catch rates through the fishing season was evident for Japanese longliners fishing in Australian waters (Stevens and Wayte 1999).","The 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada established precautionary catch levels of 250 t for Blue Shark in the target shark fishery. License limitation, a ban on finning, restrictions on gear, area and seasons, bycatch limits and restrictions to recreational fishers permitting hook-and-release only were also implemented (Hurley 1998).<br/><br/>In 1991, Australia brought in legislation that prevented Japanese longliners fishing in the EEZ from landing shark fins unless they were accompanied by the carcass.<br/><br/>Since 1993, shark fisheries in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters in the US have been managed under the Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean. The plan set commercial quotas for 10 species of pelagic sharks at 580t dressed weight annually, with recreational bag limits also applied.

Since 1974, there has been a decrease in age-at-maturity and age-at-recruitment of the species caught as well as a decrease in mean size of fish landed in the demersal inshore trawl fishery in the Southeastern Cape (Booth and Griffiths 2000). Catches in the commercial linefishery increased from 1985 to a peak in 1992 of 270 tonnes and subsequently declined to 30–40 tonnes in 2001 where it has remained stable. Using targeted effort data, there was no significant&#160; upward or downward trend in abundance (CPUE) over a 25 year period since 1985 (NMLS unpublished data). More recently CPUE in the Port Alfred commercial linefishery decreased significantly from 0.62 kg/fisher<sup> </sup>in 1985&#160;to 0.25 kg/fisher<sup></sup> in 2007; however, this decline is suspected to be due to a change in fisher behaviour and economics as opposed to a decrease in actual stock abundance (Donovan 2010, Booth and Hecht 2012). The contribution of <em>P. laniarius</em>&#160;in the commercial linefishery catch in the Southeastern Cape has steadily declined from about 26% in the 1980s (Hecht and Tilney 1989, Booth and Buxton 1997b) to around 5% in 2007 (Donovan 2010).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Pterogymnus laniarius</em>&#160;has been caught commercially since the early 1900s. This species has been an important part of the South African fishery and, from the 1950s to early 1970s, it constituted the third most important trawlfish species landed, despite being caught as bycatch. In 1964, a directed fishery was developed with the introduction of Japanese and Taiwanese trawlers to South African waters. Foreign catches peaked at the initiation of this fishery reaching 14,000 tonnes to 18,000 tonnes. From 1970, catches dropped averaging 10,000 tonnes until the introduction of an Exclusive Economic Zone in 1978 when the imposition of a small quota of 1,700 tonnes resulted in this species being caught as bycatch in the new horse mackerel directed fishery (Booth and Buxton 1997b). Foreign trawl fleets were completely excluded from South African waters by 1993. The annual catch (all sectors combined) over the past decade averages some 830 tonnes (Booth and Punt 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African linefishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term fisheries rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery 2012).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Near the Corsican coast in particular, fishing pressure is low because only a few Corsican trawlers, as well as a few Italian vessels, operate in this area (Abella and Serena 2002). A reduced number of trawlers belonging to the La Spezia fleet operate on the same grounds northwards to Viareggio harbour (the most important fishing port of the north Tyrrhenian- south Ligurian Sea). The Livorno fleet operating in the same area is also relatively small. Trawlers concentrate their effort mainly on the grounds at depths between 100 and 400 m and therefore there is a little overlap with areas in which the Viareggio fleet operate. </p>  <p>Off Tuscany (Ligurian Sea), it is mainly landed as bycatch of beam trawlers, targeting common sole and turbots, however very few of these operate in this area (Abella and Serena 2002). Most small individuals caught near shore with trammel and gill nets by these artisanal fisheries are landed. However the ban on trawling within three miles of the coast in this area of the Mediterranean Sea affords protection for this species' shallow nursery areas. Moreover, a general reduction in fishing effort on the grounds traditionally exploited by the Viareggio fleet occurred during the last 15 years because the number of vessels in operation reduced from 107 in 1985, to 78 in 2000 (Abella and Serena 2002). </p>  <p>Little information is available on the probability of survival of discarded juveniles. Preliminary experiments performed with individuals caught and successively put into marine water pools have demonstrated high rates of survival for released individuals caught with bottom trawl nets (Catalano <em>et al.</em> 2003). </p>  <p>Although this skate is one of the more exploited species in the Ligurian Sea, it is apparently relatively resilient to fishing pressure as a result of its life history characteristics. It is relatively productive due to its early age of first maturity (about three years) and relatively short lifespan (about 10 years), even if it is only moderately fecund (Abella and Serena 2002).</p>  <p>Data available for Starry Skate in the North Sea and eastern English Channel are thought to be unreliable owing to confusion between this species and Blonde Skate (<em>R. brachyura</em>) (ICES 2012). </p>  <p>Fishing mortality calculated from the model in 1978 was assessed to be 74% of total mortality, much higher than the mortality of this group due to predation (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>In the northwest Mediterranean Sea, bottom-trawling operations capture large amounts of juvenile fish due to their low selectivity (Sardà <em>et al.</em> 2004) and Starry Skate is sensitive to the type of non-selective commercial trawling operating throughout the Mediterranean Sea from hatchling to adult sizes (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2013). Results from Coll <em>et al.</em> (2013) confirmed that the species has been and still is highly affected by fishing in the Catalan Sea, particularly trawling, and is very sensitive to increasing fishing effects. Under the current situation and under situations of increasing fishing effort in the future, this skate may disappear from the Catalan Sea, as it has already happened with other rays and skates in highly exploited areas of the North Atlantic (Brander 1981; Casey and Myers 1998, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000). Fishing effects in the Mediterranean Sea are high, and it is likely populations are at low levels. </p>  <p>Continental shelves and coastal areas of the whole Mediterranean Sea are currently subjected to a high fishing pressure from a highly diversified fishing fleet (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2010), therefore posing high threat to populations of Mediterranean endemic rays and skates (Aldebert 1997, Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2010).<em> </em>Starry Skate primarily occupies these areas, and frequently occurs at smaller depths than the depth benchmark of 63 metres for White Skate (<em>Rostroraja alba</em>), which is now locally extinct in parts of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea owing to overfishing (Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Additionally, Starry Skate has a smaller latitudinal range than White Skate and a restricted geographic range, thus making it perceivably more sensitive to fishing (Notarbartolo Di Sciara 1998; Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Finally, strong declines have been documented in regions where immediate deeper refuges are not available, such as in the Gulf of Lions and the Adriatic Sea (Aldebert 1997, Jukić-Peladić <em>et al.</em> 2001). </p>  <p>A recent regional analysis of human effects in the Mediterranean Sea illustrated that fishing intensity is currently high in most coastal and continental shelf systems where this skate is distributed (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2010), therefore fishing effects may be higher than previously evaluated. However, Coll <em>et al.</em> (2013) showed that Starry Skate may respond well under decreasing trawl fishing effort and could substantially recover in the Mediterranean Sea if this were to occur.</p>","<p>The development and implementation of management plans (national and/or regional e.g., under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks: IPOA-Sharks) are required to facilitate the conservation and sustainable management of all chondrichthyan species in the region. </p>  <p>The Portuguese Administration adopted a national legislation in October 2011 (Portaria no 315/2011) that prohibits, along the whole continental Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone, during the whole month of May, the catch, the maintenance on board and the landing of any skate species belonging to the genera <em>Raja </em>or <em>Leucoraja </em>(ICES 2012). Additionally, each fishing trip is allowed a maximum of 5% bycatch, in weight, of those species to be maintained on board or landed.</p>  <p>Further research and monitoring of the population where it is fished is required to prevent declines in the future.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>  Genetic analysis suggests at least two distinct clusters: Western and Eastern Mediterranean basin, and Sicilian coast and Algeria, and possibly other countries in North Africa (Gerotto 2013).  This species was captured in both the GRUND (Italian waters) and MEDITS (northern Mediterranean basin) trawl surveys (Relini 1998, Bertrand <em>et al.</em> 2000), which began in 1985 and 1994 respectively. In the south Ligurian and north Tyrrhenian Sea it was captured over muddy bottoms, in restricted coastal areas from nine to 190 m depth, but mainly concentrated at 100 to 150 m depth. From 1999 to 2004 the difference between the Biomass Index and Density Index decreased, which may indicate a change in the population structure with a predominance of smaller specimens (Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has a higher relative abundance on the Italian and Corsican continental shelves (Baino and Serena 2000, Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nursery areas are located very close to the coast at two to 15 m depth (Abella and Serena 2005).</p>  <p>Landings of Starry Skate in the southwest North Sea and eastern English Channel, as reported by France, are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012).</p>  <p>Catches in the Aegean Sea MEDITS bottom trawl surveys, from 1998 to 2008, ranged from 24 specimens (9.85kg) in 1998, to nine (2.01kg) in 2003, to 34 (13.91kg) in 2008. Inter-annual variability was high, but there was no overall trend for the time series (Tserpes <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>There have been estimated declines in the MEDITS program in the Adriatic Sea (Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2013), and landings declined over 25 years (1969-1994) in the Gulf of Lions despite no apparent decrease in fishing effort, and in this region the species disappeared entirely from catches in waters &gt;150 m between 1957 and 1995. In waters &lt;150 m deep, it declined by approximately 20%. The same negative trend is reported for the Spanish Mediterranean area. It is suspected that these trends are likely to be representative throughout the species’ range, and thus the species is inferred to have undergone a decline of 20% throughout its distribution during the three-generation period (19 years).</p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was historically exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp). Later effort increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987).

Although it has a relatively broad geographical range, this species is most abundant from the British Isles to Portugal. There are certain areas where it is locally abundant, for example in parts of the North Sea and Irish Sea. Hence, this species seems to have a fragmented population, possibly due to the fragmented nature of its favoured habitat. This species may have declined over the course of the 20th century (Rogers and Ellis 2000). Rogers and Ellis (2000) compared standardized catch rates of demersal fish from research vessel surveys in three areas around the British Isles (northwestern Irish Sea, Devon, and southern North Sea) from 1901 to 1907 with survey catches in the same areas from 1989-1997. In this analysis, skates of intermediate body size showed marked declines in relative abundance, especially the blonde ray <em>R. brachyura</em> and the thornbach ray <em>R. clavata</em>. Furthermore, the percentage composition of the blonde ray decreased by close to 30% between the two survey periods. Catch rates in beam trawl surveys in the English Channel and Irish Sea appear steady in recent times (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005b), and there is no consistent trend in the North Sea (ICES 2006). However, these catch rates refer to all individuals and not just mature fish.<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>The blonde ray <em>Raja brachyura</em>, is relatively rare in the Mediterranean. It is not certain if it has always been rare there. The species is rare but consistently caught in the MEDITS trawl surveys from 1994 to 1999. The MEDITS survey covers the north Mediterranean coast almost continuously from west Morocco and Spain in the west Mediterranean to the Aegean Sea in the eastern Mediterranean (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Six trawl surveys are carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and the Eastern (Aegean Sea). The blonde ray has been recorded in a total of 21 of 6,336 tows performed between 1994 and 1999 in depths ranging from 10-800 m (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001).

More recent research has shown a decline in the CPUE of the adult population with the closure of the St Lucia estuarine system due to prevailing drought conditions (Mann and Pradervand 2007), which forms an important nursery area for this species (Wallace 1975a). No major changes in CPUE of the adult population have been observed between 2004 and 2012 (Mann 2012). An increase in mean size was recorded in St Lucia MPA between 2001 and 2005 and is attributed to a lack of recruitment into the adult population because of the closure of the St. Lucia mouth (Mann and Pradervand 2007, Mann 2012).

Other threats affect Whale Shark on local or regional scales.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks are presently fished in several locations. In southern China, large-scale commercial take of Whale Sharks appears to be increasing (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although Whale Sharks are not necessarily targeted, they are routinely captured and retained when sighted (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small-scale opportunistic fishery for Whale Sharks is also present in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm).&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks have previously been targeted in large-scale fisheries from India, the Philippines and Taiwan, with hundreds of sharks caught annually in each country until species-level protections were implemented (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A smaller directed fishery occurred in the Maldives until Whale Sharks were protected in 1995 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Broader-scale subpopulation reduction caused by these fisheries was raised as a possible driver of declining sightings in Thailand (Theberge and Dearden 2006) and Western Australia (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Occasional directed catch or bycatch of Whale Sharks has been documented from many of their range states, particularly where large-mesh gillnets are in common use (Rowat and Brooks 2012).<br/><br/>Tuna are often associated with Whale Sharks, and tuna purse-seine fisheries often use Whale Sharks as an indicator of tuna presence, even setting nets around the sharks (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Direct mortality in purse-seine fisheries appears to generally be low, recorded as 0.91% (one of 107) and 2.56% (one of 38) of sharks where fate was reported by observers in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, estimated mortality rates in the Western Central Pacific purse-seine fishery were higher: 12% for 2007–2009 and 5% in 2010. This extrapolated to a total mortality of 56 sharks in 2009 and 19 in 2010 (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). Observer reports on release condition from this region from 2010–2014 were generally consistent, with 50–60% of encircled sharks released alive, 5–10% dying and 30–40% of status unknown (Clarke 2015). Assuming a poor outcome for the latter category, potential mortalities in 2014 range from a minimum of 11 to 42, with a higher number possible depending on longer-term survival of the sharks released alive (Clarke 2015). Available data on the number of Whale Sharks caught are likely to underestimate total catch (Clarke 2015). The longer-term survivorship of Whale Sharks released from nets has not been examined at this stage. Common release practices, such as being lifted or towed by the caudal peduncle, are likely to cause stress, injury and possibly death to the sharks.<br/><br/>Shipping lanes, where they are placed close to Whale Shark feeding areas, can create a serious risk of vessel strikes. Whale Sharks routinely feed at the surface (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2013), and propeller injuries are commonly recorded during monitoring programs (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2006, Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). While mortality events are seldom reported in the contemporary scientific literature, they were often noted from slower-moving vessels in the past (Gudger 1941). It is likely that fast-moving, large ships do not register or report impacts, and as Whale Sharks will typically sink upon death, these are unlikely to be documented (Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008). Areas where Whale Sharks appear to be at particular risk include the Mesoamerican reef countries in the Western Caribbean (Graham 2007, R. de la Parra-Venegas pers. comm.) and Gulf states (D. Robinson pers. comm.), where a high frequency of serious propeller injuries are observed during monitoring.<br/>&#160;<br/>Inappropriate tourism may be an indirect threat to Whale Shark in some circumstances (for example from interference, crowding or provisioning). Marine pollution events occurring in Whale Shark hotspots, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2012), may result in mortality or displacement from preferred habitats. These more local threats, as well as potential future concerns such as climate change impacts (Sequiera <em>et al</em>. 2014), should be closely monitored.","The Whale Shark has been listed in a number of international conventions and agreements. The species is included in Annex I (Highly Migratory Species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a framework for the conservation and management of fisheries, and other uses of the seas. To date, no management initiatives enacted through UNCLOS have included the Whale Shark. Under the aegis of this convention, the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was introduced in 1995, which has potential for direct actions to be taken in relation to species such as Whale Shark, although none have yet been proposed (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Also in 1995, the FAO finalized a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and then in 1998 the International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Davidson <em>et al</em>. (2015) noted that only 22 National Plans Of Action had been published at that time, limiting the effectiveness of this initiative.<br/><br/>The Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 1999. This identifies it as a migratory species whose unfavourable conservation status would benefit from the implementation of international cooperative agreements. The CMS has provided a forum for the development of more direct conservation approaches with the adoption, in 2010, of a Memorandum of Understanding on the migratory shark species listed on this agreement, including Whale Shark. There were 40 signatories to this memorandum as of February 2016, which aims to improve scientific knowledge, ensure fisheries sustainability, protect critical habitats, movement corridors and life stages of sharks, while increasing public participation and national, regional and international cooperation towards these objectives. Whale Shark routinely move across political boundaries (summarised in Rowat and Brooks 2012), emphasising the importance of this unified approach.<br/><br/>Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002. This requires fishing states to demonstrate that any exports were derived from a sustainably managed population, enabling exports and imports to be monitored through a permit system. Continued presence of Whale Shark fins in Hong Kong markets, a major international transit point, despite no records in the CITES Wildlife Trade Database (http://trade.cites.org) suggests that illegal trade is occurring outside the CITES permit system. No Whale Shark fisheries have been certified as sustainable under CITES Appendix II regulations. Identifying the source of these fins, and enforcing CITES regulations, should be a key goal for managers.<br/><br/>National- or territory-level management measures for Whale Shark, via shark fishing bans or specific species protection, are in place in American Samoa, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Cambodia, Chagos Archipelago (UK), China, Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Kuwait, Maldives, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Reunion, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, St Helena Island (UK), Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau, United Arab Emirates and USA. Species-level legislative protection is an important conservation goal in countries where Whale Shark are still caught, either as a target or bycatch, including China, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan and Tanzania.<br/><br/>While many of the larger commercial fisheries for Whale Sharks have now ceased, primarily due to rapid catch reductions, fishery and trade management is still required. The active fishery in Chinese waters is almost certainly unsustainable (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). This national fishery is likely to be the largest single direct threat to Whale Shark recovery in the Indo-Pacific. Enforcement of existing laws for Whale Shark protection, and education and awareness programmes for fishers, will be an important component of management there.<br/><br/>Key habitats for Whale Sharks, in the form of coastal feeding locations or movement corridors, are protected in Australia (Ningaloo Reef), Belize (Gladden Spit), Costa Rica (Cocos Island), Ecuador (Galapagos Islands), Mexico (Yum-Balam Biosphere Reserve), Panama (Coiba Island) and the UK (St Helena Island). Site protection is necessary in some areas where high densities of Whale Sharks are present, as anthropogenic pressures on these sites could have disproportionate impact on subpopulation declines. Important aggregation areas for Whale Sharks in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), Mozambique (Haskell <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Qatar (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013) are examples. Where Whale Sharks are routinely feeding on the surface, such as off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), these areas should also be managed to reduce vessel strikes in nearby shipping lanes. This could entail either seasonal ‘go-slow zones’, or moving these routes to avoid the shark aggregations. Protection of the specific biological phenomena that influence Whale Shark presence at many aggregation sites, such as fish spawning events (Heyman <em>et al</em>. 2001, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013), would also help to safeguard these habitats.<br/><br/>Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) have banned the intentional setting of purse-seine nets around Whale Shark in the Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific (WCP) and Indian Oceans, though not yet in the Atlantic Ocean (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, a large proportion of entangled Whale Sharks (73% in WCP; SPC-OFP 2012) were not sighted prior to nets being deployed. Therefore, fisher education and regulation on safe release practices should be a key management goal. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission require that best practices for safe release of Whale Sharks be followed when they are accidentally encircled (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014), and similar guidelines were endorsed by Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission members in 2015. All RFMOs should prohibit the deliberate setting of nets around Whale Sharks, and require that Whale Sharks be safely released when they are caught accidentally (i.e., using updated recommendations following Poisson <em>et al</em>. (2014) and the summary of guidelines by Clarke 2015). Fisher education and training initiatives would be useful to facilitate implementation.<br/><br/>Whale Shark tourism is managed through legislation in Australia, Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and St Helena Island (UK). At the time of writing, whale shark tourism was not legal in Qatar, where whale shark aggregations occur in a restricted oil field (Robinson et al. 2013). Voluntary codes of conduct exist in many other tourism locations. As tourism can increase the risk of boat strikes, due to the close proximity of boats and sharks, enforcing minimum approach distances for vessels can help to reduce shark stress (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2010) and reduce the probability of boat strike. Similarly, enforcing general codes of practice for tourism industries will help to ensure their sustainability.<br/><br/>In some areas, such as China, India, Mozambique, Taiwan and Tanzania, the close proximity of whale shark feeding areas or movement corridors with net fisheries leads to regular incidental bycatch. Restrictions on mesh size, net length and fishing locations can help to avoid whale shark catch. Training in safe release, or provision of bycatch reduction technologies (deliberate weak points in nets or other ways to avoid entanglement) could help to reduce the likelihood of shark injury or mortality when interactions occur.",Decreasing,"Based on counts, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, it is inferred that approximately 75% of the global Whale Shark population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific, a population reduction of 63% is inferred over the last three generations (75 years), and in the Atlantic a population reduction of more than 30% is inferred (see the discussion for each subpopulation below). Combining data from both regions, it is likely that the global Whale Shark population has declined by &gt;50% over the last 75 years.<br/><br/>Available datasets for Whale Sharks, in particular those from coastal sites, are typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. Acknowledging this, we make the assumption that trend data in the visible fraction of the population (i.e. mainly juveniles) is representative of the adult population. <br/><br/><em><strong>Global population size</strong></em><br/>Whale Sharks are individually identifiable based on their characteristic spot patterns (Taylor 1994, Arzoumanian <em>et al</em>. 2005, Marshall and Pierce 2012). A global database of Whale Shark sightings, comprising submitted photographs from both researchers and the public, is hosted online at Wildbook for Whale Sharks (<a href=""""www.whaleshark.org"""">www.whaleshark.org</a>) (Wild Me 2016, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). As of February 2016, there were 7,011 individual sharks on this database, identified from images submitted between 1964 and 2016. However, 70% of sexed individuals (n = 3,420) were male, with the majority of these likely to be immature based on length estimates (Norman and Stevens 2007, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). This dataset is assumed to not fully represent female, small juvenile or adult sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Therefore, the total represents a minimum number of sharks alive over this period.<br/><br/>Two global-scale genetic studies on Whale Sharks have estimated genetic effective population size – the number of breeding adults – albeit based on small sample sizes of 70 (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2007) and 68 sharks (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2009), respectively. Castro <em>et al</em>. (2007) used mitochondrial DNA to estimate current genetic effective population size to be 119,000–238,000 sharks. Schmidt <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated genetic effective population size to be 103,572, with a standard error of 27,401–179,794, based on microsatellite analysis. However, lack of knowledge on species-specific mutation rates mean these estimates should not be used for management purposes (J. Schmidt pers. comm., T. Vignaud and S. Planes pers. comm).<br/><br/><em><strong>Global population structure</strong></em><br/>While global connectivity of Whale Shark subpopulations has been postulated (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013b), a large global genetic study using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analysis has demonstrated that the Whale Shark subpopulations in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are functionally separate (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-scale photo-identification studies in the Indian Ocean (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010) and western Atlantic (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), along with Wildbook online database results (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), have shown limited connectivity exists between non-contiguous countries. Based on these results, here we have considered two separate subpopulations in this assessment.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation trend<br/></strong></em>A decline of  ≥30% in the Atlantic subpopulation is inferred over the last three generations (75 years) based on data from tuna fleet observers off a likely centre of abundance for this subpopulation. Between 1980 and 2010 there was a decline in sightings per unit effort (SPUE) off western Africa, with SPUE peaking in 1995 and declining thereafter (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, sightings decreased from about 500 during the 1990s to around 150 during the 2000s. Peak-month sightings also declined by approximately 50% over this time (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>At Gladden Spit in Belize, Whale Shark sightings declined from a mean of 4 to 6 sharks per day between 1998 and 2001 to less than 2 per day in 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), with reports from diving guides indicating that numbers have remained low until 2016 (R. Graham, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the Azores, there was a significant increase in sightings in 2008 and afterwards compared to the decade before (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This was strongly correlated with the location of the 22°C isotherm, indicating that this increasing sighting trend is due to environmental conditions (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation size</strong></em><br/>Regional counts of identified sharks or modelled abundance estimates are available from many of the larger known aggregation or feeding areas. Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) photo-identified 350 individual Whale Sharks from Holbox Island in Mexico between 2005 and 2008, and estimated that 521–809 sharks participate in this aggregation. Aerial surveys from this area and the adjacent Caribbean coast have counted up to 420 sharks in a single aerial survey (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011). The largest-known aggregation as of February 2016 occurs seasonally off the Yucatan cost of Mexico, with over 1,100 identified sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Satellite-tagged sharks from this aggregation have been tracked to the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), where aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been reported (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005), south to Belize where 106 individual sharks were identified between 1998 and 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), and off the island of Utila, Honduras, where 95 sharks were identified between 1999 and 2011 (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). One shark, tagged in 2007, was tracked swimming across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The end point of this track was 543 km southeast from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, where 54 Whale Shark sightings were recorded between 2000 and 2005 (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 2008). This individual was subsequently photo-identified back off the Yucatan coast in 2011 and 2012 (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Aside from St Helena Island (A. Dove, pers. comm.), there have been few photographic records from elsewhere in the Atlantic (Wild Me 2016). There were, however, 2,297 records of Whale Sharks from the logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels between 1980 and 2010, mostly from the eastern Atlantic (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014) and particularly off the coast of Gabon (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). An additional 1,449 sightings were recorded from the Azores archipelago between 1998 and 2013 (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation trend</strong></em><br/>A decline of &gt;50% (likely around 63%) in the Indo-Pacific Whale Shark subpopulation is inferred&#160;over the last three generations (75 years)&#160;based on relevant indices of abundance from Mozambique, the broader Western Indian Ocean, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the Western and Central Pacific, and actual levels of exploitation in mainland China, the Maldives, India, the Philippines and Taiwan.<br/><br/>A commercial fishery for Whale Shark existed in Taiwan until 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Information provided by fishers operating from Hongchun harbour in southern Taiwan indicated that 50–60 sharks were caught each season in the mid-1980s, declining to less than 10 per year in each of 1994 and 1995 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Although definitive catch trends are not available, there was a significant (58%) decrease in the estimated annual catch in 1997 of 272 sharks (Chen and Phipps 2002) to a reported catch of 113 sharks over 15 months in 2001–2002 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean total length of landed sharks was noted between 2002 and 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean size of landed sharks was also noted in southern Chinese waters, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 6.3 m in 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Data from observers aboard the tuna purse-seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific noted 1,073 Whale Shark sightings, with most from the Bismark and Solomon Seas (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). The occurrence of Whale Shark in free school sets decreased by approximately 50% between 2003 (1%) and 2012 (0.5%), potentially representing a fall in abundance (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material), although a weak linear increase in occurrence probability was modelled by Sequeira <em>et al</em>. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, model performance for this latter dataset was poor (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The influence of environmental variability on sightings of Whale Shark can complicate the interpretation of trend data, particularly with the shortage of long-term datasets. A decline in Whale Shark sightings along the eastern coast of South Africa between 1993 and 1998 (Gifford 2001) was included in the proposal for listing the sharks on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2002). However, with the benefit of hindsight, the substantial variability in sighting data from this area over summer months (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 2007) and seasonal changes in their oceanic distribution (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), makes it unclear whether these earlier data are indicative of a true subpopulation decline. North of this area, in the northern Mozambique Channel and broader western Indian Ocean, a slight increase in Whale Shark sightings was noted between 1991 and 2000 based on tuna purse-seine vessel data, then a decrease from 2000 to 2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, 600 sightings were reported from the 1990s decreasing to ~200 across 2000–2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Peak monthly sightings decreased by around 50% over the study period (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Inhambane, Mozambique, in the southern Mozambique Channel, sightings declined 79% between 2005 and 2011 (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This decreased rate of sightings has persisted to at least January 2016 (S. Pierce, unpubl. data). Sharks routinely move between South Africa and southern Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), but there is limited or no connectivity between these and other known coastal feeding areas to the north in Djibouti, Seychelles and Tanzania (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Prior to the species being protected in the Maldives in 1995, catches of Whale Shark declined from around 30 each year from one of the significant fishing locations up until the early 1980s to a catch of 20 or less Whale Sharks from the entire archipelago by 1993 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Two hundred and fifty-three Whale Shark sightings were recorded by a local dive charter company in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, between 1991 and 2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Sightings per unit effort showed a significant decline over this period, with an overall decrease from 1.58 Whale Sharks per trip in 1992–1993 to 0.13 sharks per trip in 2000–2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A low absolute number of sightings persisted until at least the 2002–2003 season, although effort data were not recorded (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Following the conclusion of data collection for that study, shark sightings have likely increased in frequency according to reports from dive operators. However, sharks are perceived to be smaller than those sighted in the 1990s (P. Dearden, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) analysed tourism sightings at Ningaloo Reef, Australia, between 1995 and 2004, corrected for search effort and environmental fluctuation, and identified a 40% decline in sighting rate and a decline in mean shark length of 1.6 m over this time period (Table 1 in the supplementary material), although seasonal shifts in peak abundance to outside observation months may also have contributed to this observed decline (Mau and Wilson 2007, Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Analysis of individual sighting data from 1995 to 2006 identified behavioural heterogeneity in the sharks at Ningaloo, with the majority showing some site fidelity in that they were sighted in multiple seasons (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). This (majority) subset of the study population was increasing over the course of this work (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). Follow-up analyses on a slightly longer dataset (1995 to 2008) confirmed this result, with smaller individuals contributing in larger numbers to recruitment, thereby potentially explaining the observed decline in mean size (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009; Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, a genetic study on Ningaloo sharks indicated declining genetic diversity over five consecutive years for mtDNA (2007–2012) and two (2010–2012) for microsatellites (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Whale Sharks were fished in the Philippines prior to protection in 1998, with Whale Shark catch per unit effort (i.e., per boat) declining from 4.44 to 1.7 in Pamilacan and 10 to 3.8 in Guiwanon between two surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation size<br/></strong></em>Six hundred and seventy sharks were photo-identified in southern Mozambique between 2003 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Mafia Island in Tanzania, 131 sharks were photo-identified between 2006 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Djibouti, 297 individuals were photo-identified between 2003 and 2010 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011), while 443 individuals were photo-identified off Mahe in the Seychelles between 2001 and 2009 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011). A subset of the Seychelles dataset, comprising records from 2004 to 2009, was modelled to produce an abundance estimate of 469 to 557 sharks from that area (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Comparisons of identities collected from the Seychelles, Djibouti, Tanzania and Mozambique, comprising a total of 1,069 individual sharks sighted up to 2009, found no matches between these countries (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Norman <em>et al</em>. (submitted) updated these figures and found three international matches (all between Mozambique and Tanzania) from 1,098 individuals. A significant aggregation of juvenile Whale Sharks also occurs in the Red Sea off the Saudi Arabian coast, with 122 individuals identified to 2013 (J. Cochran, pers. comm). Aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been noted off the Qatar coast (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013). One hundred and six sharks have been identified around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2010, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012), with a modelled abundance estimate of around 74 to 104 sharks (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012). There were 1,184 Whale Shark sightings in the Indian Ocean recorded by tuna purse-seine vessel logbooks between 1991 and 2007, with almost all of these from the Western Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Eighty-two sightings were recorded off Christmas Island, Australia, between 1996 and 2008 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale shark photo-identifications range back to the early 1990s off Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009). Three hundred and eighty-six sharks were identified here between 1995 and 2008 (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009), with over 1,000 sharks identified by 2015 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Although two satellite-tagged sharks were tracked moving from Ningaloo Reef to the vicinity of Christmas Island (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010), no exchange of photo-identified sharks has been documented to date (Wild Me 2016). One photo-identified Whale Shark was, however, recorded from both Ningaloo Reef and Borneo (B. Norman, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Whale Shark abundance at Ningaloo Reef, Australia has been modelled by two studies. Meekan <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated super-population size to be 319 to 436 sharks between 1992 and 2004. Holmberg <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated annual abundance to vary between 86 and 143 sharks in the years 2004 to 2007, when length was used as a covariate. Whale Shark abundance in this area is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and several other oceanographic variables, which potentially relate to the strength of ocean currents and local productivity (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Over 820 individual sharks have now been photo-identified from the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), with large aggregations recorded from around Donsol (Quiros 2007), Oslob on Cebu Island (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014, Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and Pintuyan on Southern Leyte (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Excluding the Philippines, 326 sharks have been photo-identified from Southeast Asia (here including Cambodia [3], Indonesia [64], Malaysia [32], Myanmar [4], Taiwan [7] and both coasts of Thailand [216]) and added to the global database by February 2016 (Wild Me 2016).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Eastern Pacific, Whale Sharks are seasonally present in small numbers around Darwin and Wolf islands in the north of the Galapagos Archipelago (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. (2014) identified 82 individuals here from 2011–2013 and estimated an annual study population size of 695±166 individuals for the Galapagos Islands. Males and immature females are rarely observed at this location, so this estimate refers predominantly to large, apparently pregnant females (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two hundred and fifty-one individual sharks were photo-identified in the Gulf of California, Mexico, between 2003 and 2009: 129 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, 125 from Bahía de La Paz and smaller numbers from other sites (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Modelled abundance estimates from this dataset were 54 in 2008 and 94 sharks in 2009 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, and between 19 and 62 through 2005–2009 at Bahía de La Paz (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside of these areas (Galapagos Islands and Mexico), few photo-identified sharks have been added to the global database from the Eastern Pacific (Wild Me 2016). Twenty-five whale sharks were reported from tuna purse-seine vessel observers in 2014 (Clarke 2015).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

In some regions of its distribution (e.g. parts of South America) inshore fishing is intense. This species is taken as a utilized bycatch of artisanal trawl and net fisheries in South America (Cervigón <em>et al.</em> 2002). Although the meat is considered of poor quality, it is often salted and consumed (Cervigón <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>The continental shelf of Venezuela is thought to be intensively exploited. In Venezuela, demersal trawl effort has increased in both effort and efficiency during the past 50 years (Mendoza and Marcano 1994). Between 1990 and 2003 the commercial trawl fleet had increased from about 150 vessels to 400 shrimp trawlers operating on the continental shelf (Mendoza and Marcano 1994, Mendoza <em>et al</em>. 2003). In addition an artisanal fleet of 20,000 small vessels and about 1,000 medium and long-range vessels exists (Mendoza <em>et al.</em> 2003). The medium and long range fleet targets medium pelagics using pelagic longline and snappers and groupers (<em>Lutjanus purpureus</em> and <em>Epinephelus</em> spp.) using hand line and demersal longline (Mendoza <em>et al.</em> 2003). Overall temporal trends in total reported catches for Venezuela showed a steep increase in landings through the 1980s and 1990s, from about 150,000 t/year to over 350,000 t/year (Mendoza <em>et al</em>. 2003). Bycatch taken by shrimp trawlers off Venezuela was estimated at 96,000 tonnes annually and bycatch/shrimp ratios are typically between 5 and 15:1 in the region (Charlier 2000). Charlier (2000) indicates that although only a small part of this catch is utilized, several species have apparently disappeared from the bycatch. No information is available on the composition of catches at this time.<br/><br/>Intensive trawling also occurs in Trinidad and Tobago's waters (Mohammed and Chan A Shing 2003). Bycatch of the shrimp trawl fleet is considerably higher than the target catches. Total bycatch in these fisheries declined from 13,712 t in 1987 to 4,099 t in 2001 and the species composition of this bycatch has not yet been examined (Mohammed and Chan A Shing 2003). Data reporting is poor in these artisanal fisheries and official catches for some species, in some areas or time-periods, may under-represent true catches by 200-500% (Medoza <em>et al</em>. 2003). This species may also be vulnerable to the artisanal gillnet fishery that targets mackerel in coastal waters off Trinidad and Tobago and takes sharks as bycatch (Chan A Shing 1999).<br/><br/>In Guyana there is a partially directed gillnet fishery for sharks (~600 vessels) which captures both demersal and pelagic inshore species. This fishery operates in estuarine and shallow coastal waters (at depths of &lt;40 m) (Chan A Shing 1999). About 100 industrial shrimp trawlers also take sharks and finfish as bycatch, but no details are available on the composition of the bycatch.<br/><br/>Inshore fishing pressure is also generally intense off Brazil, where significant declines in <em>R. horkelii</em> have been documented. This species is also collected for the commercial aquarium trade in Ceará state, Brazil.<br/><br/>Threats to this species throughout its range off Caribbean Islands (north of Trinidad and Tobago) are not well known. Inshore fisheries appear to comprise beach seines, balahoo seine and gillnets that target small coastal pelagics and traps and handlines that target reef, deep slope and shelf demersals (Zeller <em>et al</em>. 2003). Trammel net fisheries have targeted Caribbean spiny lobster (<em>Panulirus argus</em>) off Grenada since the 1980s and take a significant bycatch. The use of trammel nets is now prohibited in Grenada but still continues illegally (McConney and Baldeo 2007).","None currently in place.

It also represents 2% of the catch in gillnets and 6% of the catch on longlines (Stevens 1999).  Despite these catches the Australian population does not appear to have been adversely affected.   <br/> <br/>In Indian waters it is commonly taken gillnet and trawl fisheries (Devedoss <em>et al.</em> 1989).  There are a number of studies in Indian waters that have assessed the status of the population based on demographic approaches. Krishnamoorthi and Jagadis (1986) estimated that in Madras waters <em>R. acutus</em> was being under-exploited. Kasim (1991) estimated that along the Verval coast that the species was being fished below its maximum sustainable level, with males fished more heavily than females. The results of these assessments are questionable as they applied simplistic teleost based methods. As such the results are treated with caution.  Since these assessments were undertaken the Indian elasmobranch catch has increased dramatically (Anderson and Simpfendorfer, in press) and this species is likely to have become more heavily exploited.   <br/> <br/>Data from other areas is limited. It is known to be landed in other countries, but there is no other data available on the status of populations or fisheries.","Australian fisheries are managed, but there is no assessment of population status and no species-specific regulations.",Unknown,The section of the population in western Africa is geographically isolated from the remainder of the population.

Recent commercial landings of this species indicate that it accounted for over one-third of all landings of small coastal sharks in the south-eastern United States during 1996-1999. In 1998 and 1999, over 90% of small coastal sharks were landed in Florida's east coast, the majority of which were caught with drift gillnet gear. Commercial landings of Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks averaged 61,000 individuals from 1995-1999 (Cortés 2000b).<br/><br/>Recreational catch estimates from several surveys indicate that about 72,000 Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks were caught annually from 1981-1998, ranging from a minimum of about 18,000 sharks in 1985 to a peak of about 137,000 sharks caught in 1991 (Cortés 2000b). Additionally, bycatch estimates from the shrimp trawl fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico indicate that about 1.75 million individuals were caught annually from 1972-1999 (Cortés unpubl.).<br/><br/>The Atlantic Sharpnose Shark is also heavily exploited in Mexico. A monitoring programme conducted in the Gulf of Mexico between November 1993 and December 1994 showed that it is the most important species in the artisanal fisheries, accounting for 46% of the landings numerically, especially in Campeche where 46% of the total is landed (Castillo <em>et al.</em> 1998). By month, the highest landings corresponded to May and October. This species is caught mostly with gillnets. Elsewhere this species has been documented as bycatch in Canada.<br/><br/>Nursery areas for this species are located inshore and adults frequent inshore waters, making this species vulnerable to exploitation and human-induced habitat degradation.","In the United States, the Atlantic Sharpnose Shark is classified as a small coastal species in the Federal Management Plan (FMP) for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, together with the Blacknose Shark (<em>Carcarhinus acronotus</em>), the Finetooth Shark (<em>C. isodon</em>), the Bonnethead Sharl (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), the Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>), the Atlantic Angel Shark (<em>Squatina dumeril</em>) and the Caribbean Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon porosus</em>) (NMFS 1993). The small coastal shark complex is not currently considered to be overfished, but there are fishing regulations in effect, which include an annual commercial quota of 1,760 t dressed weight, and a recreational daily bag limit of two sharks per vessel per trip, with an additional allowance of two Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks per person per trip. A more recent FMP (NMFS 1999) called for more stringent measures, including a reduction of the annual commercial quota for small coastal sharks to 359 t and making the Atlantic angelshark, Caribbean sharpnose and smalltail sharks prohibited species.<br/><br/>This is a very abundant species, with early age at maturity, short lifespan and generation time, and moderately high litter size and population growth rates, capable of withstanding a higher level of removals than many other species of sharks.

Regulations currently include a minimum size limit of 12 inches total length, gear restrictions, an Annual Catch Limit (ACL), and a recreational bag limit of five per person/day in addition to the aggregate 10 snapper allowed per recreational person/day. The recreational ACL was 412,480 lbs for entire year in 2015. The commercial ACL was 876,520 for 2015, with the ACL split into two seasons (438,260 for 1 January through 30 June, and an equal amount for 1 July through 31 December). The commercial and recreational sectors are also now required to use non-stainless steel circle hooks when fishing natural baits north of 28°N latitude and dehooking tools to reduce bycatch mortality. There is a 1,000-lbs. (gutted weight) trip limit for Vermilion Snapper (reduced to 500 lbs. since 75% of the quota has been met or projected to be met). Commercial snapper/grouper vessels must have onboard NMFS-approved sea turtle release gear and follow Smalltooth Sawfish release protocol. Several SAFMC marine protected areas that prohibit fishing for snapper/grouper species include preferred habitat and known spawning locations for Vermilion Snapper off South Carolina and Florida (Sedberry<em> et al. </em>2006). In the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Vermilion Snapper is managed through the Reef Fish FMP. Management measures for the recreational fishery include gear restrictions, special management zones, a minimum size limit of 10 inches total length for up to 10 Vermilion Snapper per person/day within the 20-fish reef fish aggregate recreational bag limit. Non-stainless steel circle hooks and dehooking devices are required. Vermilion Snapper may not be used as bait. For-hire recreational vessels must comply with the more restrictive of state or federal regulations when fishing in state waters. Commercial regulations include the 10-in total length minimum size.

In Florida state waters, the majority of landings (80%) are in the Gulf of Mexico, with 64% of the statewide landings in the commercial sector (FWC 2014). Landings for this species in the US Gulf of Mexico were relatively low until the mid-1970s, when commercial landings increased every year until a peak in 1993 of approximately 1,200 mt, and then declined 33% by 1996. After 1996, there has been an overall increasing trend in commercial landings through 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014). Recreational landings increased through the 1980s, then declined by about 50% between 1992 and 1996; recreational landings have remained fairly stable with moderate increases since 1996 (Schirripa 2000, NMFS pers. comm 2014). In the southeast U.S., total biomass and spawning biomass both gradually declined during the 1950s and 1960s, then steeply declined during the mid-1970s through 1980s. The SEDAR 17 (2008) assessment indicated that F2007 for Vermilion Snapper in southeast U.S. waters exceeded MFMT (F2007/FMSY = 1.27), which indicates overfishing. Spawning biomass had remained above MSST (SSB2007/SSBMSY = 0.86) throughout the time series, indicating that the stock was not overfished in 2007. However, the SEDAR 17 update stock assessment (2012) suggested much uncertainty in the terminal estimate of South Atlantic U.S. Vermilion Snapper status. The stock in 2011 was estimated to be not overfished (SSB2011/SSBMSY = 0.98) and not undergoing overfishing (F2009-2011/FMSY = 0.67). Since the mid-1970s in the southeast US, there has been more than a 60% decline in total biomass (1975 - 2011); current biomass is estimated to be below BMSY (SEDAR 2012, see figure 19 on pg. 77). <u>In the South Atlantic, the estimated decline over three generation lengths is 20% over 18 years to 66% over 42 years (SEDAR 2012)</u>.

Based on summary information from FWC (2014), the SEDAR 9 (2006) assessment indicated that F2004 for the Gulf of Mexico Vermilion Snapper stock did not exceed MFMT (F2004/FMSY = 0.65). Spawning stock biomass was greater than MSST, and the SEDAR panel concluded the Gulf stock was not overfished at the beginning of 2005. The SEDAR 9 update stock assessment (2011) maintained that Gulf Vermilion Snapper stock was not overfished and was not experiencing overfishing through 2010. <u>Based on SEDAR 9 (2006), biomass in the Gulf of Mexico declined by 45% over the past 19 yrs and SSB by 33.5% over the past 24 yr (within an estimated range of three generation lengths of 18-42 years)</u>. A stock assessment for <em>R. aurorubens </em>that accounted for changes in shrimp trawl fishing effort, expected to change bycatch rates of <em>R. aurorubens</em>, suggested that the population was not overfished or experiencing overfishing in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Linton <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and in Madagascar, the number of pirogues (small-scale fishing boats) rose from ~5,000 in 1983 to ~22,000 in 1996 (Cooke 1997). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Oman (19,000 artisanal boats) and Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Cripps&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Barrowclift&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018).

In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>","<p><span lang=""""EN-US"""">  </p><p><span lang=""""EN-US"""">There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for wedgefishes.

However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion).&#160;In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, there are several relevant historical accounts and more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. While only one of the contemporary datasets is from the known range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (the landings dataset from Iran), these are considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Yusup <em>et al. </em>2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran (see below), Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30–45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p><br/>To expand on point four above in relation to Iran (a range state of the Whitespotted Wedgefish), landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (<em>Rhina ancylostoma</em>), Bottlenose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus australiae</em>), Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>R.</em><em>&#160;djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (45 years).<br/><br/>While this is the only time-series data available for the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of this species with the exception of South Africa (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines have not occurred across large areas of the Western Indian Ocean. The following provides some species-specific examples of the situation relevant for the Whitespotted Wedgefish which supports this conclusion. </p><p>In southern Mozambique, anecdotal reports suggest that artisanal longline fishing led to declines in the Whitespotted Wedgefish (which was one of the main target species of the fishery) as this species was abundant on reefs before longline fisheries began in the early 2000s and subsequently are only seen in low numbers&#160;(Pierce&#160;<em>et al. </em>2008). In Zanzibar, fisher interviews indicated that there were perceived declines in wedgefish or that they are rare (Schaeffer 2004); wedgefishes were a retained bycatch of commercial prawn trawling in Tanzania (Rose 1996), and intense fishing pressure across the Tanzanian shelf is likely resulted in population reduction mirroring those outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific more broadly. In Madagascar, there was a decrease in the size of wedgefish caught in artisanal fisheries over time (Humber <em>et al. </em>2017), thought, in part, could be due to the targeting of larger individuals. A steep decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) can be inferred from reported catch reductions from 10-20 sharks per day in 1992 to 1-3 sharks per day in 1995 in Morondava, West Madagascar, with fishers moving further afield to fish (Cooke 1997). Whitespotted Wedgefish, a high-value target species, would likely have declined by a similar order of magnitude.<br/><br/>In South Africa, although the Whitespotted Wedgefish&#160;reaches the Eastern Cape Province, it is common only in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). There was a marked decline in CPUE of the species in shark bather protection nets in KZN during the period 1979-2017 (Nomfundo Nakabi, KZN Sharks Board, pers. comm. 2018). This decline is not considered to be a good indicator of population reduction as it may be explained, at least partially, by shift in gear deployment whereby nets were gradually lifted off the substrate (which would reduce the capture of demersal rays).<br/><br/>Overall, it is inferred that this species has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction due to actual levels of exploitation over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Targeted fisheries have existed in certain areas, though these fisheries ceased after localised depletion. It may still be taken as by-catch in demersal fisheries off the Iberian Peninsula. Anecdotal information suggests that this species, including localized populations, have declined severely. In 2002, the ICES Study Group on Elasmobranch Fishes was asked to comment on the status of white skate and  """"considered that there was a high probability of population decline, both in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast, and in the Celtic Seas. For example, there was a directed long-line fishery in Douarnanez (Brittany) in the 1960s that collapsed (white skate are no longer listed on French fishery statistics), and a similar decline is thought to have occurred in the Irish Sea"""" (ICES 2002). As discussed in the population section, historical data (early 1900s) from English surveys suggest that they occurred in UK waters, though no recent records exist (Rogers and Ellis 2000). Their status further south is unclear, though they may be landed around the Iberian Peninsula (ICES 2006), accounting for about 0.3% of skate and ray landings in Portugal. It is also noted that this species may be confused with shagreen ray <em>Leucoraja fullonica</em> and sandy ray <em>L. circularis</em>, and improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. (2000) also report this species to have undergone a decline and even disappearance from other shelf areas, notably the Irish Sea.   <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>:  <br/><em>R. alba</em> is captured as bycatch to the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years.  <br/> <br/>As discussed in the population section, the historical occurrence of the white skate within the Gulf of Lions is unclear, however the change in characteristics of the fisheries operating in this area can provide an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), since then effort increased to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp (between 1974 and 1987). Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea to have been displaced to target small pelagic fish, however this Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croation, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles of this species makes it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other rajids (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean is approximately 20 mm.","<strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>:  <br/>There is a minimum landing size of 40 cm for skates and rays caught in the inshore waters of various parts of England and Wales, as implemented by Sea Fishery Committee bylaws. Though there are no species-specific management measures for this species, there is a total allowable catch (TAC) for skates and rays in the North Sea and adjacent waters, and they may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries (e.g., mesh size regulations, effort reduction). Given the low abundance of this species, species-specific management measures may also be warranted. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>: <br/>For the conservation of chondrichthyans within the Mediterranean region, the FAO SAC Subcommittee on the Environment and Ecosystem recommended that all fishing states implement a Mediterranean Action Plan for the Management and Conservation of chondrichthyans, in line with IPOA sharks (International Plan of Action on the management and conservation of chondrichthyans). <br/> <br/>The MEDLEM project was adopted at the last SAC meeting (FAO, Rome 2005) for data collection within the Mediterranean basin on large elasmobranches.  The Bern Convention encourages research programs aimed at the assessment of the conservation status of chondrichthyans in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Italy a national action plan (PAN-SHARKS) was co-ordinated by ICCRAM (Central Institute for Marine Research) within the guidelines of the Bern Convention and FAO IPOA-Sharks (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2002, Vacchi and Notarbartolo 2000).   <br/> <br/>The species is listed in the Appendix 3 of the Bern convention (Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats), Appendix 3 of this convention requires """"regulation of species populations to keep them out of danger"""". This species is also listed by the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea, this convention concerns specially protected areas and biological diversity within the Mediterranean Sea and lists the white skate on the Annex III, whose exploitation is regulated.",Decreasing,"Little information is available on the population size of the white skate.  The data does indicate that this species has undergone a reduction in abundance and is now considered rare in the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean.  <br/> <br/>Historically, within the Mediterranean this species was captured frequently off northern coasts of Tunisia in the mid-1970s and the coast of Morocco in the early 1970s (Capape 1976). It was described as being more or less frequent in the Northwestern Mediterranean (1965) and the French coast (1950 to 1960s) and Italian Seas (1972) (Capape 1976).  However, a time series of comparative trawl surveys running from 1957 to 1995 in the Gulf of Lions, in the Eastern basin of the Mediterranean failed to catch any white skate specimens. This consisted of eight separate surveys, conducted by four survey vessels. A total of 1,359 tows were carried out on shelf and slope areas extending from the coast to 800 m in depth (which includes the known depth range of this species) (Aldebert 1997).   <br/> <br/>In the eastern Mediterranean, it was captured in the Adriatic (1963) and the limit of its eastern distribution is Greece (Capape 1976). This species was regularly captured by fisheries in Tunisian waters and was common in all Tunisian coastal waters but captures were more frequent in the north part of the Tunisian coast (Capape 1976). This species is now rare along the Tunisian coast (Bradai 2000).   <br/> <br/>In the Adriatic Sea, comparative trawl surveys indicate that Rostroraja alba was present in 4% of hauls of the """"Hvar"""" 1948 survey (based on 138 valid hauls in depths of up to 400 m). Since then, two time series of trawl surveys have occurred in the Adriatic Sea. The Italian national trawl survey National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation (GRUND) began in 1982, and the MEDITS survey began in 1985, both surveys are still ongoing. <em>Rostroraja alba</em> was captured sporadically and infrequently in both of these surveys, typically in &lt;2.6% of hauls in any year. Of the GRUND surveys, it was captured in approximately 1.7% of hauls in the central, northern and southern Adriatic Sea (Marano <em>et al</em>. 2003).   <br/> <br/>In addition to the Adriatic Sea, the MEDITS survey actually operates on the north Mediterranean coast almost continuously from western Morocco and Spain in the west Mediterranean to the Aegean Sea in the eastern Mediterranean (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Six trawl surveys are carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and the Eastern (Aegean Sea). A total of 6,336 tows were been performed between 1994 and 1999 in depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. This species was not recorded in the central and northern MEDITS surveys, but was captured in the southern MEDITS survey in 1998 and 1999, in 1.4% of the hauls. However, uncertainty exists as to the validity of the identification of this species. It is suspected that earlier surveys may have confused this species with Leucoraja circularis and or Dipturus oxyrhinchus (F. Tinti and N. Ungaro pers. comm. 2003). The white skate was recorded in only nine hauls in the western central area (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/>  <br/>From other regions within the Mediterranean, only one specimen was caught with a bottom trawl net by a commercial vessel in Livorno (the Ligurian Sea) in 2003 (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2003). Also in the Northwestern Ionian sea, only a single individual of this species was reportedly caught in 1997 (Sion <em>et al</em>. 2003).   <br/> <br/>From the data presented it can be inferred that this species is now very rare and also the MEDITS survey suggests a substantial reduction in geographic range. In fact, this species was only recorded from the western area of this survey (Morocco, Spain, France). Evidence from the Gulf of Lions survey suggests its presence along French coast may be in doubt. As described above, Aldebert (1997) reported that the white skate was historically absent from the Gulf of Lions, however the MEDITS survey data casts doubt over the occurrence of this species across the length of the French coast. The current distribution of occurrence for this species represents a small fraction of its former range. From the former frequency of capture of this species in the western Mediterranean it can be inferred that this species has undergone a substantial but currently unquantifiable decline in abundance and extent.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Total catch of all three populations of bonitos (including <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">S. orientalis</span>) in the eastern tropical Pacific was reported by Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) as 10,000 metric tons, dropping to 300–2,600 mt in 2000–2005, and then increasing to 17,000 mt in 2007 (IATTC 2008).<br/></p>","Pacific Bonito is included in the federal Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan as a """"monitored species"""", meaning it is not actively managed. Currently, only California statues and regulations apply to the take of this species. If there is an increase in take of Pacific Bonito, its status could be changed to actively managed. It is legal to target Pacific bonito commercially and recreationally year round (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>After the last population assessment in 1982, a minimum size limit of 24 inches (61 cm) or five pounds (2.3 kg) was instituted for both commercial and recreational fisheries. In the recreational fishery there is a ten fish bag limit and up to five undersized fish can be retained. Commercial vessels fishing with round haul gear (e.g., purse seine, lampara net) may retain 18 or less by number of undersized fish. When using gill or trammel nets, only 1,000 pound (454 kg) or less of undersized Pacific bonito may be retained (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>The minimum size for <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">S. chiliensis lineolata</span> in Peru is 52 cm FL with a maximum tolerance of juveniles od 10% of the catch. There are no catch quotas.",Decreasing,"The northern subspecies, <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Sarda chiliensis lineolata</span>, is a component of the commercial purse seine fishery as well as a popular recreational fish in southern California. Catch landings for this subspecies have greatly fluctuated, and therefore it is difficult to estimate the effect of fishing on its population. It is not clear what is causing these fluctuations. Pacific Bonito populations fluctuate on a decadal scale in a similar manner as the northern anchovy. Current conditions indicate that the eastern Pacific is in a warm water regime that favours Pacific Sardine over Northern Anchovy, which is a primary prey species for Pacific Bonito. It is therefore thought that these fluctuations in both anchovy and Pacific Bonito are associated with warm and cold water periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>Commercial landings for this subspecies have declined steadily since the mid 1980s, but have increased moderately in recent years, from 291 metric tons in 1997 to 803 metric tons in 2008. The trend over the last 15 years seems to be low landings for most years interspersed with high yield years. Competition with higher valued fisheries was likely part of the decline observed in landings during the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, increased regulation, decreased stocks and lower market demand likely contributed to the decline. In 1982, Mexico began restricting foreign vessel access to its near-shore fisheries. Prior to this closure, 50–90% of Pacific Bonito landed in the United States was caught off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. Now less than 10% originates in Mexican waters (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>FAO reported landings for <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Sarda chiliensis</span> (both subspecies) highly fluctuate and range from 35,016 tonnes reported in 1950 to 11,3161 tonnes in 1961; to 2,383 tonnes reported in 2003 and 6,243 tonnes reported in 2006 (FAO 2009). Landings in California and Mexico have fluctuated greatly over the past 50 years from less than 1,000 metric tons to nearly 14,000 mt in the early 1970s (worth $1,222,000 in total California landings in 1976) (Collette and Nauen 1983). Combined landings of U.S. and Mexico in 1995 was about 6,800 mt, while in the last five years (2000–2005), the landings have been under 500 mt (FAO 2009), representing a decline of over 90%, assuming landings are a good proxy for population trends.<br/><br/>The combined Chilean and Peruvian landings of the southern subspecies, <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Sarda chiliensis chiliensis</span>, went from almost zero in 1,940 mt to a peak of around 110,000 mt in 1961 and dropped off to about 40,000 mt in 1973 (Collette and Nauen, 1983). From 1995–2005 the catch reduction went from around 30,000 mt per year to around 1,000 to 5,000 mt per year (FAO 2009). Reported landings for this species (in Ecuador, Chile and Peru) plunged to between 1,000 and 5,000 mt per year between 1998 and 2005. A conservative estimate is a reduction in catch of around 80% since 1995.<br/><br/>In Peru, however, there was a decrease in effort during the late 1990s which may reflect the decrease in catch at this time. Also drops in catch may be related to reduction in anchovies, but also during this time there was an increase in effort for Jack Mackerel and <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Scomber japonicus</span>. Although the catch is rising again in 2005 and 2006, this is likely due to an increase in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Chile, less than 10,000 mt in the 1960 and 1970s was estimated to be caught, and this was the period of the highest catches (R.

In the eastern central Atlantic, current catch of sardinella (mainly <em>S. aurita</em> and <em>S. maderensis</em>) is not sustainable.&#160;In 2007, assessments made by the Working Group for Small Pelagics &#160;recommended a&#160;50%&#160;decrease in effort in the sardinella fishery. For 2008, total catches were not to exceed the level recommended last year 220,000 tonnes. However, reported catches in the past four years (2006-2010) ranged from 240,000 to 320,000 tonnes (FishSTAT J).&#160;Effort and catch should be reduced in order to avoid a future depletion of the stock, especially as these stocks are highly dependent on recruitment&#160;(FAO CECAF Report 2011). Where the stock is considered overexploited (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin),&#160;catch should not exceed 20,000 tonnes. In the central stock (Nigeria, Cameroon), catch should not exceed 150,000 tonnes (FAO CECAF 2011).",Unknown,"Utilizing mitochondrial DNA control region, a highly variable marker suitable for population-level studies, researchers found that there is virtually no gene flow between the Mediterranean and eastern central Atlantic (Chikhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Population size and structure of&#160;<em>S. aurita</em>&#160;is strongly tied to climatic events. Recent hydrological changes in the northern Gulf of Guinea have been implicated in observed increases in catches of<em>&#160;S. aurita&#160;</em>in&#160;Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, as well as changes in spatial and seasonal distributions (Binet and Servain 1993). Throughout the Gulf of Mexico, schools follow planktonic food populations, from warm coastal pelagic waters to inshore, making them fairly ubiquitous.&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><strong><em>Western Central Atlantic</em>:</strong> This species is caught throughout the area, with the main fishing grounds off Venezuela. It is marketed fresh or canned and widely used as a baitfish (Munroe 2002, Mendoza&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). In Cuba, this species constitutes a minor component of the mixed clupeoid catch (F. Pina-Amargos pers. comm. 2012).&#160;The countries represented in FAO Fishstat from the Caribbean include Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela. Landings also occur off Grenada, but at a low level. Between the years 1999-2010 combined regional landings declined by 73% (128,048 mt to 34,900 mt); however, effort is unknown.&#160;<br/><br/>The Venezuelan fishery is strictly artisanal and uses relatively small boats with artisanal-style beach seines or purse seines that are operated manually from shore (Rueda-Roa 2012).&#160;Catch in the Venezuelan artisanal fishery peaked in 2004 with about 200,000 t, and later declined significantly (Mendoza 2015). High effort and increased catchability due to reduced upwelling may explain large landings that were recorded in 1998 and 2004 (Rueda-Roa 2012). Additionally,&#160;beginning in 2004, an environmental regime shift reduced upwelling in the southeastern Caribbean and has likely caused declines in sardine food and thereby recruitment (Taylor<em> et al</em>. 2012). There is also evidence that estimated biomass declined between the 1980/90s to 2009, but is not quantified (Gassman <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<br/>A commercial fishery for&#160;<em>S. aurita</em>&#160;is active off the Florida (USA) Gulf of Mexico coast and is almost exclusively conducted via purse seine (FWRI 2010). Landings were limited by a 4.1 million pound annual quota between April 1989 and January 1991, after which a 500 pound trip limit was enacted. Before these regulations, the annual state-wide landings of this species had already declined from 6.4 million pounds in 1987 to 3.5 million pounds in 1988. Between 1989 and 1994, state landings were stable around 1.7 to 2.4 million pounds. In 1995, landings dropped significantly due to the constitutional amendment prohibiting the use of purse seine gear within three miles of Florida’s Gulf coast and within one mile of the Atlantic coast (FWRI 2010). Since then, landings have rebounded somewhat, as the commercial fishery adjusted to fishing in offshore waters. Total landings in 2009 were 22% higher than the average landings in the previous 5 years and were 38% lower than the 1982-2009 historical average landings. There was considerable variability in landings from 2000-2009, but are generally higher than those during 1992-1999 (FWRI 2010). Despite significant reductions in the commercial landings since 1995, fishery independent trawl-acoustic surveys (1994-2003) indicated that the abundance of important baitfish species (including&#160;<em>S. aurita</em>) had not increased in recent years (Mahmoudi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, B. Mahmoudi pers. comm. in FWRI 2010). These findings suggest that factors other than fishing may have caused changes in abundance within the survey areas (FWRI 2010).<br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>Mediterranean</em>:</strong> This species was commercially valued in the Mediterranean until the 1970's, after which, demand declined (A. Di Natale pers. comm. 2007). A Mediterranean stock assessment conducted by&#160;GSA3 (in 2003) assessed its population as stable (O. Kada pers comm. 2007). It is harvested at low levels in Northern Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea, as the large majority of harvests (&gt;85%) originate from the Eastern Central Atlantic fishing zone, in waters regulated by CECAF.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong><em>Eastern Central Atlantic:</em>&#160;</strong>This species has high commercial importance in the eastern central Atlantic, sometimes contributing up to 90% of the clupeid catches; although, catch records are usually mixed for Sardinella species. It is caught by canoe fishermen using ring nets, gillnets, and beach seines; by local purse seiners; and by industrial trawlers. Its population in this region is composed of four stocks: the Saharan sedentary stock; the Senegalese-Mauritanian stock; the sherbo stock (approximately 12°-7° lat. N) (Garcia 1982, Maxim and Maxim 1988); and in the south transitional zone to Angola.&#160;The FAO CECAF 2011 report considers its population&#160;in the eastern central Atlantic to be overexploited and reiterated a recommendation to reduce fishing effort.&#160;<br/>Since the late 1980's, FAO reported catch data for this region has significantly fluctuated: from a high of 457,759 t in 1991, to a low of&#160; 235,622 t in 1994. Over the past 10 years (2000-2010), catch have also fluctuated with some indication of decline that could be as high as 36%, depending on the average endpoints used (FishSTAT J). Effort data are not available.<br/><br/>In Mauritania, capture of this species&#160;declined&#160;between 2006-2010. However, it is difficult to interpret this trend, as there are seasonal differences in abundance due to upwelling in the area as well as variance in effort as the number of licenses can change year to year. Due to the recent development of the fishmeal production industry, effort in general is increasing. Relative to other countries, Senegal was intensively fished, especially in 2011-2012, and effort is significantly increasing. In addition, juveniles are now also being caught. Catches from Morocco to Gambia are increasing, which may reflect an increase in effort in this region (Sidibe pers. comm. 2012). In Gambia, it is caught only in artisanal fisheries and catch and effort have been steadily increasing. In Guinea, catch statistics are mixed with other Sardinella spp., with&#160;<em>S. aurita</em> comprising the minority of the catch and effort doubled between 2001-2009. In Ghana, the stock is shared with Cote D'Ivoire, and effort increased from 9,000 boats to 13,000 boats over the past 10 years. Mean fish size has also decreased and landings have fluctuated over the past 10-20 years, but the overall trend is of decline. In Benin, this species is not as abundant as it is in Ghana or Cote'Ivoire. In Nigeria, juveniles and adults are caught together and effort is also increasing.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The overfishing of small pelagic fisheries has been reported in the Sulu-Celebes Sea due to an increase in the improved efficiency of fishing gears and an increase in the number of vessels (Pedrosa-Gerasmio <em>et al.</em> 2015). A large proportion (~70%) of juveniles can be caught in eastern Java due   to the increased use of purse seines (Simbolan <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is possible that overfishing in the Philippines may pose a threat to this species (Giducos <em>et al. </em>2015); however, a recent report (Rola <em>et al. </em>2018) suggests that local subpopulations respond well to fisheries management practices (e.g., annual closures). Other major threats to this species are unknown.","Species-specific conservation measures are in place for this species in parts of its range (e.g., the Philippines).

For example, in Indonesian waters, the development of policy and stock monitoring programs have been suggested to reduce fishing efforts and avoid catching illegal sizes of this species (Setyohadi <em>et al.</em> 2016, Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). More research and population stock assessments are recommended to better understand the population of this species. Likewise, increased monitoring and regulation of fisheries catches is needed to prevent population decline of this commercially important species.",Decreasing,"<em>Sardinella lemuru</em> is widely distributed throughout the Philippines and is the most abundant species of <em>Sardinella</em> (Willette and Santos 2013). It is also highly abundant in Indonesian waters, specifically the Bali Strait, contributing and estimated 80% to total production between 1976 and 2007 (Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Landings were not reported from Indonesia in the Western Pacific during the years 2005 – 2011 (FAO 2016); however, it is unlikely that this species was not landed given its long term commercial importance in the region.

Overall, the reconstructed catches are higher than landings reported to the FAO, averaging just over 71,700 tonnes (1950 – 2010). However, catches were not reconstructed from some countries where this species is abundant and commercially important (i.e., the Philippines and China: Munroe <em>et al.</em> 1999, Willette and Santos 2013, Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pedrosa-Geramio <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Therefore, an exponential regression was applied to a time period beginning where a decline in landings reported to the FAO can be attributed to exploitation (1990 - 2014), resulting in a decline of 32% over the most recent ten years available (2005-2014), thought to represent three generation lengths for this species.&#160;</p>  <p>We suspect there are small parts of this species range where it is not exploited and therefore, a 32% decline probably represents a slight overestimate. Furthermore, reports show that this species is fished sustainably in the Zamboanga Province (Region IX) of the Philippines (E-value = 0.5: Barut <em>et al. </em>2017) following the successful implementation of annual fishery closures in 2011 (Rola <em>et al. </em>2018). However, based on an inferred decline of 32% in landings reported to the FAO and existing evidence that this species has been, and currently is being, overfished in parts of its range (i.e., increase in gear efficiency, the number of vessels and market value: <span style="""""""">Purwanto 2011, </span><span style="""""""">Pedrosa-Gerasmio <em>et al.</em> 2015, Setyohadi <em>et al. </em>2016, Simbolon <em>et al</em>. 2017) but likely not all of its range</span>, it is suspected that the true population decline is at least approaching 30%.<br/></p>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Observed variations in the geographical distribution of subpopulations show a similar pattern in each isolated region where this species has been heavily exploited (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Barange <em>et al. </em>2009); overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during times of high abundance. Periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions result in fishery collapse in areas which generally have viable fisheries (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Given this species has an anti-tropical geographical distribution and prefers cooler waters, a global increase in average sea surface temperature (SST) may result in prolonged or permanent range contractions in all isolated regions, though more research is needed to determine the extent this may affect this species.","No known species-specific conservation measures are currently in place globally, though its total distribution overlaps with existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). Regional fishery management initiatives (i.e., yearly monitoring, stock assessments, quotas, limited entry fisheries and seasonal closures) are in place and implemented to a varying degree (Barange <em>et al. </em>2009) throughout most of it range, especially in Australia (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the United States (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018). Off California, fishing moratoriums have been put in place for this species during the 1960s - 1980s (Whitehead 1985), and more recently in 2015 - 2017 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018).",Unknown,"Landings of <em>Sardinops sagax</em> are reported to the FAO as three nominal species: <em>S. sagax</em>, which represents subpopulations off Australia, and in the eastern Pacific off the western coasts of North and South America; <em>S. ocellatus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off South Africa; and <em>S. melanostictus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off Japan. Globally, combined landings of the three nominal species average just over 6.5 million tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 with a peak of 25 million tonnes in 1985 (FAO 2016). Catch reconstructions are available for <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (1950 - 2010) which appear to encompass global catches and report lower annual catches, averaging just over 3.7 million tonnes annually, but otherwise track very closely with landings reported to the FAO (Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches show a sharp increasing trend between 1970 and the mid-1980s followed by peak landings between about 1984 - 1988; a maximum of about 25 million tonnes was reported to the FAO in 1985 (FAO 2016). Following 1988, landings and reconstructed catches declined to quantities similar to historical values (&lt; 5 million tonnes) by the late 1990s, and continued to decline below historical catches until the end of the available time series (2010 for reconstructed catches and 2014 for reported landings: FAO 2016, Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>According to Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), previous theoretical considerations and attempts to find discrete genetic stocks suggest it is unlikely that this species can be subdivided into genetically definable stocks within the individual current systems. However, more recent work has been completed (e.g., Schwartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999, Miller 2006, Ohshimo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Roux <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160; Demer and Zwolinski 2014, van der Lingen <em>et al. </em>2015, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) to suggest otherwise; at least two or three stocks are recognized in each current system where this species occurs (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Subpopulation-specific information</strong><br/><em><br/>Northeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (northern Mexico to southern Alaska), southern (Baja Peninsula  to southern California) and Gulf of California (Baldwin <em>et al. </em>2012,  Demer and Zwolinski 2014, Izzo<em> et al.</em> 2017). The northern and southern units appear to move north and south along the coast in  synchrony, but spawn in separate localities and seasons (Garcia-marales  <em>et al.</em> 2012, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an important commercial fishery for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Current subpopulation information is limited. Previously, the subpopulation collapsed in the 1950s and early 1960s resulting in a large contraction of its geographical range; it was virtually absent from waters north of Point Conception (34°N) until the 1980s. A minor recovery of the subpopulation increased its range as far north as San Francisco (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). A recent trawl survey (2001) indicated that this species was largely concentrated offshore between San Francisco and the Point of Conception (33 and 38°N: Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). In April of 2011, total biomass of the subpopulation was estimated to be ~ 0.494 million metric tonnes (Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Independent surveys conducted by the U.S. and British Columbia have reported a significant decrease in sardine biomass (DFO 2011) and spawning stock biomass since 2006 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Spawning stock biomass has reached historically low levels in recent years (2014 - 2017: Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Total coast wide biomass in has declined by ~57% and ~ 79% between 2006 and 2010 in U.S. and Canadian waters, respectively (DFO 2011). The observed decrease in biomass coincided with unusual ocean conditions which may have affected overall abundance and distribution (DFO 2011), similar to other global subpopulations of this species. Recruitment in U.S. waters has also declined since 2005 - 2006 with the exception of a brief period of modest recruitment in 2009 - 2010; a small increase in recruitment was observed in 2016 but the estimate is highly variable and based off limited data (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). The 2001 - 2015 year classes have been among the weakest observed in recent history (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Exploitation rates of this species in U.S. waters have averaged about 11 % since 2005 with peak of 13% in 2013; both the U.S. and total exploitation rates of this species in northern U.S. were less than 1%&#160; in 2016 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><em>Southeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as<em> S. sagax sensu stricu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (southern Ecuador to central Peru), central (southern Peru to northern Chile), and southern (off Chile: Schartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999). In this region, this species is a dominant small pelagic resource along with the engraulid, <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(Passuni <em>et al. </em>2018) where it is known to undergo periods of high and low abundance, similar to other global subpopulations. Landings reported to the FAO (1950 - 2014) from the southeast Pacific are presumably referring to this subpopulation and are driven by landings from Peru and Chile with an average of 1.1 million tonnes (FAO 2016). The trend in reported landings tracks very closely with the global trends in landings of this species and is represented by a sharp increase between 1970 and the early 1980s followed by a peak in 1985 (~6.5 million tonnes) and a sharp decline until 2014, the most recent year available in the time series (936 tonnes: FAO 2016).<br/><br/><em>Northwestern Pacific </em>- This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is further subdivided into two units: one which occupies the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, and another which occurs along the Pacific coast (Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In this region, this species is important to fisheries and has experienced wide fluctuations similar to other global subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Declines in landings were reported in the 1940s and the fishery was greatly reduced in the northern portion of its range (e.g., Honshu and Hokkaido) and was primarily restricted to the western Sea of Japan and East China Sea (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The contraction of spawning grounds was also observed during this time (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The subpopulation reportedly recovered in the 1970's and expanded its spawning habitat to encompass grounds around southern Kyushu (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989), specifically including Tanegashima Island, Osumi Islands (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018). The population in the NW Pacific has shown a continuous decline from about 1987 - 2003 (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Biomass decreased from ~14 - 19 million tons in the 1980s to less than 1 million tons in the late 1990s; biomass remains at very low levels in the most recent years available (2005: Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, egg abundance has declined by at least an order of magnitude from the 1980s to the early 2000s; juvenile abundance has also declined since the mid-1990s (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/><em>Southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) is further subdivided into at least four units with some degree of overlap: southwestern coast (off Western Australia), Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf, Bass Strait and Port Phillip Bay (off Victoria and Tasmania), and eastern Australia; additional evidence exists for the subdivision of units off Western Australia and the east coast (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species is important to fisheries off Australian and New Zealand waters. Catches have increased since the beginning of the available time series (1975) with some fluctuation (Ward <em>et al. </em>2014a, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches peaked off Western Australia in the 1990s (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) but have remained at low levels over the last two decades following two mass mortality events which impacted the entire population in the mid - late 1990's (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whittington <em>et al.</em> 2008). A recent stock assessment off South Australia was conducted and indicated that catch and effort has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 after the establishment of a large fishery in 1991 (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017); it is possible that the increase in catch is also associated with high abundance years in this region. For example, the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) has increased over the last decade from 30,000 t in 2007 - 2009, to 42,750 t in 2017; total annual catches in South Australian waters have also increased (~30,000 t in 2007 to ~38,000 t in 2016: Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Significant catches in Australia have been taken from New South Wales, Victoria and in Commonwealth waters (Ward&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b), though a large majority of catch in this region is taken from South Australia (specifically Spencer Gulf), which represents only a small portion of this species total range (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017); there is concern regarding the potential local depletion in the Spencer Gulf (Izzo <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The fishery in South Australia (Spencer Gulf) was established in 1991 and is currently the largest fishery by volume in the country (Total Allowable Catch in 2016 was 38,000 t: Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Effort has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging from ~760 to 1100 net-sets per year (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual CPUE have risen from ~30 t/set-net in 2007 to over 40 t/set-net in 2015 and 2016 (Ward<em> et al.</em> 2017). The estimated spawning stock biomass for 2017 was estimated to be between 236,00 t - 305,000 t and is the largest obtained for the southern stock of sardine in Australian waters; the southern stock is classified as sustainable as the spawning biomass for 2017 exceeds the target reference point of 150,000 t in the harvest strategy for the South Australian Sardine Fishery (SASF: Ward <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/><em>Southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus</em> or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is further subdivided into at least two units: northern (Namibia) and southern (South Africa); additionally, the southern unit is broken down further into three subunits: east of Agulhas Bank, west of Agulhas Bank, and off KwaZulu-Natal (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2006, Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Okomadu 2017). Limited information is available related to this subpopulation, though it is commercially important and reported to follow similar boom-bust patterns of the other four global subpopulations. This species supports a major fishery in African waters and has largely experienced major fluctuations in catches (Okumadu 2017). Off Namibia, the biomass of this unit crashed in the late 1960's; a slight recovery was observed in the 1990's but various stresses (e.g., heavy fishing pressure and abnormal environmental conditions such as hypoxia and the Benguela El Niño) caused a further decline in biomass and catches (Okumadu 2017). Presently, low sardine biomass can only allow limited fishing activity (Okumadu 2017). Within South Africa, the small pelagic fishery which targets this unit is the largest commercial fishery by volume and the second largest in net value (Okumadu 2017). The South African Sardine purse seine fishery has been concentrated along the western coast since the 1940's (Okumadu 2017). This species has undergone wide fluctuations in abundance since the beginning of industrial-scale fishing (Okumadu 2017). Similar to Namibia, high sardine catches taken in South Africa in the early 1960s were followed by drastic declines (Okumadu 2017); a slow recovery followed after management measures were put in place in the mid - 1980s (Okumadu 2017). A slight increase in biomass and catches between 2001 and 2005 (~ 4 million tonnes) resulted from good recruitment; however poor recruitment in 2004 has led to another substantial decrease in biomass in recent years (~ 250,000 tonnes in 2007 - 2008: Okumadu 2017) and has remained at a low biomass since about 2006 (DAFF 2016). In 2015, the Total Allowable Catch for this species was set below 90,000 t for the first time since 1997 which represents its depleted state in South African waters (DAFF 2016). <br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span style=""""""""><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

Mann ORI pers. obs., Mann <em>et al. </em>2000). Fishing regulations are recommended because of its relatively slow maturing reproductive strategy. More genetic information would be useful for the management of this species.",Stable,"<em>Sarpa salpa </em>is considered to be underexploited in KwaZulu-Natal (van der Walt and Govender 1996). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in KwaZulu-Natal increased between 1975–1977 and 1994-1996 from 0.22 fish/angler/day to 0.51 fish/angler/day but declined during 2009–2010 to 0.34 fish/angler/day (Joubert 1981, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Dunlop 2011). However, this may be a result of subtle differences in survey design in the mentioned studies rather than a decrease in abundance (Dunlop 2011) and should therefore be viewed with caution. An increase in CPUE was also recorded on the Eastern Cape coast between 1985–1986 and 1994–1996 from 8.98 g/fisher/hr to 13.4 g/fisher/hr (Clarke and Buxton 1989, Brouwer 1997). Unpublished data from long-term monitoring of shore anglers' catches in KwaZulu-Natal (National Marine Linefish System) revealed a decrease in CPUE from 1985–2008 from 0.25&#160;fish/angler to 0.1 fish/angler but this trend is likely to have been at least partially effected by the introduction of a daily bag limit of ten fish per angler per day introduced in 2005 (Mann and Dunlop 2013).<br/><br/>Fishing mortality was recorded at&#160; F=0.81 year<sup>-1</sup>&#160;in Kwazulu-Natal from 1994-1995 with SBPR at 60% (van der Walt and Govender 1996).&#160;There was an increase in catch composition between 1975–1977 (20.3%) and 1994–1996 (42.9%) in Kwazulu-Natal but a subsequent decline from 2009–2010 (34%) (Joubert 1981, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Dunlop 2011). As mentioned previously, minor differences in survey design by these studies may have resulted in the observed changes in percentage composition (Dunlop 2011). A slight increase was recorded between 1985-86 (21.5%) and 1994–1996 (23.1%) in the Southeastern Cape (Clarke and Buxton 1989, Brouwer 1997).

Over-exploitation by fisheries is a major threat to this species. It is fished mainly by spear fishing, trammel nets and gill nets. This species is heavily exposed to fisheries during spawning aggregations at the mouth of estuaries. In addition to fishing pressure at its spawning grounds, degradation of estuaries from coastal development threatens the nursery grounds of this species.<br/><br/>As well as direct fishery exploitation, the species may also have been disturbed by divers and spear fishermen, forcing the animals to be less concentrated and much more dispersed in small coastal caves and below rocks (A. Di Natale pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>This species is currently being researched for potential use in aquaculture (Chatzifotis <em>et al. </em>2006).","The Brown Meagre is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on Annex III of the Barcelona Convention. The Bern Convention Appendix III requires Parties to protect listed species, but a certain amount of exploitation is permitted if population levels allow. The Annex III listing on the Barcelona Convention also requires the exploitation of these species to be regulated (Abdul Malak <em>et al.</em> 2011). Marine protected areas (MPAs) potentially enhance the long-term sustainability of coastal fish resources, and have had a positive effect on the Brown Meagre spill-over fishery resource (Di Franco et al. 2009, Forcada et al. 2009).<br/><br/>There was a moratorium of spear fishing in Corsica for this species.&#160;Since 2004, Montenegro included the species in the prohibited list for juvenile fishes, the limits was 30 cm total length (MAFWM 2004).<br/><br/>The species was assessed as Vulnerable for the Mediterranean regional assessment in 2007 (Biszel <em>et al. </em>2011) based on&#160;FAO data on&#160;fishery declines for the period 1980-2005. More recent data show a fluctuating increase in reported landings figures. Whilst it is acknowledged that the species can attain moderately large sizes (up to 50-70 cm) and is highly targeted in artisanal, semi-commercial and recreational (sportfish) fisheries, the species has been shown to benefit from in-place conservation actions including no-take zone and marine protected areas (Di Franco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Forcada&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).",Decreasing,"Population data are not available from across most of this species range, with most detailed information available for the Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) catch statistics are only reported from Turkey, Tunisia and Cyprus. These statistics indicate a decrease in landings from a peak of 735 t in 1988, followed by fluctuating declines to 161 t in 2005, with an average of 148 t in the period 2001 to 2005. This indicates an approximate 70% decline in landings over 25 years (1980-2005), which can be used for a proxy for a decline in population size, assuming that there was no reduction in fishing effort during this time. These trends may be representative of the whole of the Mediterranean Sea, though it may be more stable in some parts of the northern Mediterranean Sea. The species used to be relatively common in many areas in the Mediterranean in the 1970s compared to the present (A. Di Natale pers. comm. 2007).

Illicit harvest (i.e., poaching) may be of concern. The North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries conservatively reported illegal recreational landings of adults at 12,823 and 33,486 individuals in 2001 and 2002. Individuals inhabiting estuaries may also incur elevated natural mortality because they are more likely to inhabit areas of degraded habitat quality relative to their offshore counterparts (Reyier <em>et al.</em> 2011). Red tide events have a strong and negative effect on juvenile&#160;recruitment. During the years of 2003 and 2004, CPUE for this species in the Gulf of Mexico was 10.02 and 13.77, respectively. Following a significant red tide event, CPUE in 2005 and 2006 fell to 2.63 and 0.87, respectively (Flaherty and Landsberg 2011).","There are regulations for this species in the United States, however, there is a need for regulations in Mexico, specifically improved protection of spawning grounds.

In 1988, the creel limit was reduced to five individuals with a minimum size of 41 cm with one fish allowed over 69 cm in order to reduce fishing pressure on spawners. These same regulations remain in effect today and populations are very robust (Brogan 2010). Migration timing for each age class can be used to create temporal closures as a fishery management tool to protect this species during particularly vulnerable periods (e.g., to protect them from passive gear like gill nets) (Bacheler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<p>&#160;<br/></p> 				 			 		 		 	 	 		 			 				 					<p>&#160;<br/></p>",Stable,"This species is relatively common throughout its range. There is no indication that current range is not consistent with historical range.<strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>United States:&#160;</strong>Studies have consistently shown that this is one of the most common fishes in the southeastern United States estuaries and adjacent coastal waters. It is well-known and well-studied. It supports one of the most popular recreational fisheries along the southeastern U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico, but presents one of the greatest fishery management challenges. Since juveniles are most abundant in estuarine waters and inlets and individuals older than age five inhabit deep offshore waters, juveniles tend to experience higher rates of exploitation than the offshore adult population.&#160;Selectivity of age three red drum may be higher than currently assumed, which implies that mortality of age three fish may be underestimated in the stock assessment (Bacheler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Post- release mortality of adult red drum in the recreational fishery to be 1.9% to 6.7% (with rates depending largely on hook style).&#160;Abundance data are available from fisheries-dependent (landings data reported to U.S. federal and state fisheries research and management agencies) as well as fisheries-independent surveys (conducted by US federal and state agencies). Population density data (CPUE and other indices of abundance) are available from fisheries independent surveys conducted by U.S. federal and state agencies as well as a number of well-documented studies conducted by fisheries agencies and academic institutions.&#160;Due to overfishing of this species in the 1980s,&#160;a total cessation of harvest in federal waters was declared in 1987. Since then, commercial harvest has remained near or below 40,000 kg yr<sup>–1</sup>, with a&#160;small commercial fishery remaining in Mississippi state waters (Powers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Recreational harvest is limited to state waters and remains heavily regulated. In contrast to the offshore commercial fishery of the 1980s, the historic and current recreational fishery targets primarily juveniles (one to four year olds) in inshore habitats (Murphy and Crabtree 2001). Annual recreational landings have increased to over six million kg yr<sup>–1</sup>. Even at this level, escapement of juveniles into the adult stocks was reported to be in excess of the 30% required by the fishery management plan for all Gulf of Mexico states. This increase suggests that the stock may be on a trajectory for full recovery; however, there is little current information about the&#160;age, growth, condition, and population status of red drum that inhabit offshore waters, to evaluate this conclusion. A fishery- independent study conducted off Alabama and Mississippi reported that older individuals were present in the offshore areas and that individuals younger than 24 years were much more common than 25+ year olds. Individuals that were 25 years old at time of capture would be assigned to annual cohorts between 1983 and 1985 and therefore subject to fishing pressure prior to the federal moratorium (1987). These findings agree with previous work conducted in Florida, where the distribution of adult red drum sampled with purse seines showed that fish before the 1984 year class were rare (Powers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Evidence for the effectiveness of the moratorium was provided by the elevated frequencies of the 1991 and 1992 year classes. The classes between 1986-1989 correlate to periods of low exploitation after state management actions. These studies show how the effectiveness of management measures can be tested by fishery-independent monitoring of year-class strength (Powers&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). It is now very common throughout the Gulf of Mexico and has recovered from declines caused by overexploitation by commercial fisheries. Since the fishery moratorium caused a complete closure on catch of this species, data on the adult population are so limited that scientists are unable to assess stock status (total biomass or spawning stock biomass). Instead, the stock is managed to ensure a certain percentage of immature females survive to become reproductive adults (Barbieri pers. comm. 2009). This 30% escapement rule is consistently met (J. Tolan pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>There are no fisheries for this species in Mexico, only&#160;management for aquaculture (Chao 2002). It is common along the north coast of Mexico and consumed on a small-scale basis (H. Espinosa Perez pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Non-native populations: </strong>There are possibly two separate subpopulations of this species off western Taiwan; a larger subpopulation on the west coast of Taiwan and a smaller one around Matsu.

In Northeast Brazil, average annual biomass is estimated to be 4,237 t, and 35.9% of the stock is being exploited annually (Nóbrega and Lessa 2009). However there has been a decrease of average length of individuals caught, from 50.3–38.2 cm total length (TL) between 1998 and 2000 (Nóbrega and Lessa 2009), and by 33% from the 1960s to 2000 (Lucena <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2004).

The 2008 preliminary catch of small tuna amounted to 55,876 t, of which 3,755 t was King mackerel (STECF 2009). There are more than 10 species of small tunas, but only five of these account for about 88% of the total reported catch by weight.

Since there are no genetic differences between the two Gulf of Mexico populations, the species is managed as two migratory stocks: Gulf of Mexico and the southeastern US coast (Gold <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2002). Winter migrations occur from both stocks to south Florida where the mixed stock is targeted by a winter fishery. The south US Atlantic stock contributes a significant percentage of landings in the winter mixing zone (Clardy <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008). In the 1980s, this species was considered overfished throughout its US range. The Gulf of Mexico population which has experienced an estimated 2.5-fold increase in spawning stock biomass since the early 1990s displayed a decline in size-at-age for ages 2–7, while the Atlantic population, which has experienced an approximately 45 decline in estimated spawning stock biomass over the same time period, displayed an increase in size-at-age for ages 4–10 (Shepard <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2010).

In some areas larger specimens may be landed for human consumption or they may be landed as bait for whelk fisheries. They have a high survivorship when discarded from trawl fisheries. Revill <em>et al</em>. (2005) reported a 98% discard survival rate from a Western English channel trawl fishery and Rogriguez-Cabello <em>et al</em>. (2005) found a 90% survival rate for <em>S. canicula</em> discarded by commercial trawlers in the southern Bay of Biscay. Another study reports an almost 100% survival rate of released individuals of this species (Sanchez <em>et al.</em> 2000). <em>S. canicula</em> is frequently recorded misleadingly as """"dogfish"""" in fisheries landings data.<br/><br/>Although <em>S. canicula</em> has been reported to be locally extirpated from the Wadden Sea between the Netherlands and Germany (Wolff 2000a,b), this area is at the edge of the species' distribution. Therefore this localised depletion is not considered to have had a significant effect on the entire global population.<br/><br/>Portuguese official fisheries statistics for landings of <em>Scyliorhinus</em> spp (<em>S. canicula</em> and <em>S. stellaris)</em> in the Algarve (DGPA 1988-2001), show that average landings were 115,079 kg per year during the years 1988, 1989 and 1990, compared to averages of 154,820 kg per year during the years 1999, 2000 and 2001. These values show that there has been an increase of 34.5% in landings by the commercial fishing fleet of this genus in the Algarve during the last decade. However, this increase in landings could mean that there has been a great reduction in discards (DGPA 1988-2001). Only <em>S. canicula</em> were recorded during bottom longline and trammel net surveys off the Algarve (at depths of 200-550 m and 10-90 m, respectively) analysed by Erzini <em>et al</em>.

Although demersal fishing pressure is intense in many parts of the species range in the Mediterranean, this species has a high post-discard survival rate.

This species is one of the most abundant elasmobranchs within the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>The EU-funded Development of Elasmobranch Assessments project (DELASS) concluded that <em>S. canicula</em> would be best assessed as forming local populations (e.g., on the level of an ICES division) because of the limited movements and migrations of the species and its oviparous nature, assuming that immigration and emigration from adjacent populations are either insignificant or on a par (Heessen 2003). Survey trends in most shelf seas (including the North Sea, northwest Scotland, Irish Sea, English Channel, Celtic Sea and Cantabrian Sea) seem stable (Heessen 2003, MacKenzie 2004, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005b, ICES 2007). There may be many separate sub-populations of this species, due to its lack of migration between different areas, e.g. Hebrides and west coast of Scotland, southern North Sea and English Channel. Stocks around northern Scotland, particularly the Shetlands and the Hebrides, may be increasing in size (MacKenzie 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>Data from the MEDITS trawl surveys indicates that this species is common in the Mediterranean (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). It had a high frequency of occurrence (28% of trawls) and high abundance in these trawl surveys, being particularly abundant in the Gulf of Lions and the Catalan and Aegean Seas. Maximum biomass indices were reported off northeast Corsica between 50 and 100 m depth (340 kg/km²) (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001). Juveniles made up the main proportion of the population (78% of total population) sampled (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). Comparison between trawl surveys in 1948 and 1998 showed no significant differences in distribution and abundance of <em>S. canicula</em> in the Adriatic Sea (Jukić-Peladić <em>et al</em>. 2001) although there is evidence of constant increasing of trawl fishing pressure. Fishery independent and fishery dependent data from the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian seas were compared by Abella and Serena (2002) to determine population trends.

In addition, the capacity for population recovery of this species is affected by a low level of interconnectivity between isolated populations around islands far from the continental coast. The true extent of the impacts of fisheries on <em>S. stellaris</em> populations throughout the Mediterranean is difficult to evaluate, partly due to the lack of species-specific reports. In many areas, for example the Balearic Islands fishery and in Italian waters, <em>S. stellaris</em> is reported together with S. canicula or even as """"elasmobranchs"""".<br/><br/>Taken as bycatch of the semi-industrial fisheries of Spain, the Adriatic Sea, Sicily and Cyprus and also in artisanal fisheries elsewhere and is regularly present in fish markets in Malta, Tunisia, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey (Compagno in prep.). In European waters, <em>S. stellaris</em> is less important as a fisheries species than <em>S.  canicula</em>, but is regularly taken in bottom trawls, gill nets, bottom set long lines, handlines and fixed bottom nets, and occasionally pelagic trawls (Bauchot 1987, Compagno in prep.).<br/><br/>Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, effort in trawl fisheries in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean) evolved from a small low powered fleet (total nominal horse power of 2, 700), increasing to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974-1987). In a study of the long-term changes in groundfish diversity in the Gulf of Lions, Aldebert (1997) reports that there was a clear decrease in the abundance of this species since 1970. It was present in catches from the late 1950s to the 1980s and then disappeared from the catches after 1988 Aldebert (1997). Although not abundant, it seems that S. stellaris stocks have decreased in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>A decline also seems to have occurred around Albania and the Balearic Islands: <em>S. stellaris</em> was frequently caught as bycatch by the bottom long-line and lobster fisheries, but catch numbers have decreased despite no change in the lobster fishing effort and equipment (G. Morey pers. obs.). Also of some concern is that the Balearic population has little connection with other populations of <em>S. stellaris</em> due the species' limited dispersal capacity. In the Balearic Islands S. stellaris was monitored from 131 hauls made between 40-1,800 m depth from 1996-2001 (Massutí and Moranta 2003), and while Galeus melastomus and <em>S. canicula</em> showed the highest abundances of all the elasmobranch species, S. stellaris was absent. Additionally, no specimens of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">S. stellaris</span> have been captured during 12 trammel net surveys carried out in the Balearic Islands between 2000 and 2003 (Morey et al. in press). Current captures for this species in the Balearic Islands are sporadic. Fishermen report the species as common about 15 years ago, and abundant in lobster gillnet fishery, but becoming very rare to date (G. Morey pers. obs.). Jardas (1984) classified the species as rare in the western half of the Adriatic Sea in 1984, although <em>S. stellaris</em> does appear in trawl surveys carried out in 1948 and 1998 (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In the northeast Atlantic abundance data are insufficient to ascertain the current status, though due to its large size and patchy distribution, it may be at risk of localised depletion.","This species is protected in six marine reserves around the Balearic Islands, but further monitoring and protection measures are encouraged throughout its range.",Unknown,"<span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Scyliorhinus stellaris </span>is less abundant than <em>S. canicula</em> (Compagno in prep).<br/><br/>This species was reported in only 34 of 6336 (1%) tows conducted during the Mediterranean wide trawl (MEDITS) survey from 1994-1999 (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). Its overall biomass was estimated to be 0.6kg/km², with a higher presence in the eastern central Mediterranean area (Adriatic, Ionian sea and Albania: 1.2 kg/km²). The GRUND project (1985-1998), a series of experimental trawl surveys carried out on the continental and upper slopes of the central Mediterranean, reported 19.42% presence of this species in 22 surveys in Italian waters. Given percentage presence, this species was the 18th most common species, with the first and second most common species being Galeus melastomus and <em>Scyliorhinus canicula</em> (respectively 84.30% and 83.88% presence in trawls (Relini <em>et al.</em> 2000)).<br/><br/>No accurate data on population size is available for the Northeast Atlantic, although <em>S. stellaris</em> tends to be caught in low numbers only during trawl surveys.

The decline may be attributable to a set of factors, including a shift in the depths fished, economic reasons (the value and quality of elasmobranch landings fell during the period of the study) and probable over-exploitation of both the target and bycatch species.<br/><br/>The fishery operates from 140–750 m depth, but currently tends to work at increasingly greater depths (with some variation according to the seasonal tides, and a recent average depth of up to 710 m per tide (2003 data from observers on commercial vessels)). The deep bathymetric distribution of this species (200–1,600 m) may afford it some protection from deepwater fisheries such as this, and others operating in the eastern Atlantic. However, the trend for this fishery to exploit deeper waters in an attempt to avoid catching small hake (when the Mauritanian government imposed a minimum legal length of 30 cm for black hake in 1996), may be of concern if this species is fished throughout its depth range in the future. Other fleets from Spain and other countries are also fishing in this area with both fresh and freezer vessels focusing on other demersal and semipelagic stocks, but little information is available to assess their impact on demersal stocks (Fernández <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2005).","There are no conservation measures in place for this species. <em>Scymnodon ringens</em> is not included in the list of species covered by the European Union Total Allowable Catch for deepwater sharks, thus it is not covered by fisheries measures.<br/><br/>Recommended actions:&#160; The affect of deepwater fishing pressure on this species is of concern, particularly off Mauritania, where this species is taken of bycatch of expanding deepwater fisheries.

There are some indications of overfishing in the Gulf of Mexico, although the models used for this assessment need to be refined. Declines are considered to be on a local basis, and is therefore not a major threat to its global population.","Fishing regulations for this species in U.S. waters were first implemented in 1987 (SEDAR33 2014).&#160;<em>Seriola dumerili</em>&#160;is included in the snapper-grouper complex and is managed by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC). The fishery is highly regulated off Florida.&#160;Stock assessments for this species are conducted as part of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). A rebuilding plan was established in 2003 under this FMP. The fishery is subject to a 28-inch FL minimum size limit, three fish/person/day bag limit for recreational harvest, 2-day possession limit for charter vessels, 36-inch fork length minimum size limit for commercial harvest, gear restrictions, and an overall total allowable catch limit (SEDAR33 2014).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on spawning frequency and fecundity with size and age as well as tagging studies to determine seasonal movements for Gulf of Mexico Greater Amberjack (SEDAR33 2014). Improvements in the management and monitoring of the recreational fishery off Mexico is highly recommended.",Unknown,"<em>Seriola dumerili </em>is very common in museum collections (536 lots with a maximum of 17 individuals in one lot) (<a href=""""http://www.fishnet2.net/"""">Fishnet 2</a> Portal, accessed 5 August 2013). It is common off Cuba (F. Pina-Amargos pers. comm. 2012) and occasional to uncommon in Jamaica (M. Curtis pers. comm. 2012).&#160;It<em> </em>is occasionally observed near the reefs of Kuwait (Carpenter <em>et al. </em>1997).<br/><br/><em><strong>U.S. Atlantic<br/></strong></em>Since the 1950s, it has been&#160;an important component of recreational sport fisheries in U.S. waters (Harris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). There are no clear landings trend within the past two decades; a low of 149 tonnes was recorded in 1999 followed by a 72% increase to 538 tonnes in 2000. Over the past 10 years, catch has been within the range of 400-700 tonnes. Commercial landings for Greater Amberjack increased from 3 mt in 1962 to 1,013 mt in 1991. This increase in landings may have been due to hook and line fishermen shifting toward this species during the mid 1980s when human consumption of this fish increased. Commercial landings off the Atlantic coast of southeastern USA have declined steadily since 1991 (when region-wide species landings data first became available) to a low of 195 mt in 2003. Similarly, recreational landings have shown a steady decline, albeit with relatively large fluctuations, since a peak in landings in 1987. Despite regulations implemented by SAFMC, recreational and commercial landings continued to decline. Nonetheless, spawning potential ratio (SPR) for this species of the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States was reported to be 84% in 1993 and the stock is currently being managed using an SPR value or 40%, suggesting that the stock is not experiencing overfishing and is not overfished&#160;(Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). It&#160;is a component of the bycatch in the commercial snapper-grouper fishery operating off the southeastern coast of the USA, with the majority retained.&#160;Spawning stock biomass showed significant declining trends from 1950 to the late 1990s from over 10,000 mt to about 1,000 mt, a roughly 90% decline. Spawning stock biomass increased from the late 1990s through about 2003, then decreased through 2006. Fishing mortality has decreased since the mid-1990s. The population trend over the last 10-15 years is one of increase (SEDAR 2013).<em><br/></em><em><br/></em><em><strong>Gulf of Mexico<br/></strong></em>This species was considered to be overfished&#160;with overfishing occurring in the Gulf of Mexico (Turner <em>et al</em>. 2000). However, there was much uncertainty in the stock status with indices of relative abundance being inconsistent among sectors (SEDAR33 2014). The most recent stock assessment (SEDAR33 2014) was not able to assess a overfished or overfishing status due to conflicting results from different model runs. Predicted annual fishing mortality (F) estimates showed increasing, but low levels of F through the late 1980s. Steady and large increasing trends in F were estimated between the early 1980s and continued through the mid-1990s. Estimated total annual Fs have generally declined since the mid-1990s, with the exception of years between 2003 and 2005, which showed increases in F (SEDAR33 2014).&#160;Total biomass and spawning biomass show significant declining trends from the beginning of the time series (1950) lasting through the late 1990s, but then increased through about 2003 (SEDAR33 2014). Since the mid-1980s, average age in the population has experienced moderate increases and decreases; estimated average age declined by 20% since 2010, but no formal conclusion can be made from this trend (SEDAR33 2014).&#160;<u>Using an exponential regression of the&#160;</u><u>estimated&#160;</u><u>total biomass for the entire time series (1950-2012) there was a decline of 39% over the past 20 years (1993-2012) (three generation lengths) (SEDAR33 2014; Table 3.2.4.1 pages 109-110). The recent relative stability in total biomass may reflect better management; however, the SEDAR33 stock assessment team was unable to determine whether the stock is actually overfished, suggesting that there still may be concerns surrounding its recovery.<br/><br/></u>In the Gulf of Mexico off Mexico, it is taken as bycatch in a variety of fisheries using longlines and handlines, gillnets, and trolling (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial landings reported to the FAO by Mexico are not species-specific and besides <em>S. dumerili</em>, may also contain catch of <em>S. zonata</em>. Between 1994-2013 (past three generations), these landings fluctuated with no perceivable trend (FAO 2013). It does not support an established directed commercial fishery; however, there is a valuable sportfishery, especially near Alacranes Reef off Yucatan, but no landings records are collected (A. Aguilar Perrera pers. comm. 2015).&#160;It is not managed in Mexican waters and landings statistics for sportfisheries are not collected; therefore, its population status is not fully understood. <u>Under the assumption that this pelagic species has equal proportions of its population spread throughout the Gulf and the area is roughly equal to half in Mexican waters and half in U.S. (54% and 46% of coastline, respectively), we assume that its population in the Gulf has experienced at least a 20% decline due to exploitation.</u> There is some evidence for separate population structure within the Gulf, where the northern Gulf population does not appear to mix often with the Florida Keys population (Gold and Richardson 1998, Murie <em>et al.</em> 2011). Connectivity of amberjack populations between the Gulf and the Caribbean is not well understood; however, at least one study found low marine larval connectivity in general between the Caribbean and the Gulf Yucatan region (Cowen <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em><strong>Eastern Central Atlantic<br/></strong></em>Based on the CECAF south working (2009), which covers Guinea Bissau to Angola, landings for Carangidae spp. from 1994-2008 show an increase up to 20000 in 2001 and are stable until 2008, when they drop to 12000 metric tons, but not all countries are reporting (CECAF 2009). Based on ECA country reported landings to FAO for carangids nei landings peaked between 1970 to 1980, averaging around 24,000 metric tonnes per year, and declined in 1980 to an average of 18000 metric tonnes per year, fluctuating between 16,000 and 18000 per year, and has remained relatively stable since.<br/><em><br/></em><em><strong>Persian Gulf<br/></strong></em>It is considered highly desirable as a food fish in this region and is valuable where sold in markets especially in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia&#160;(Ibrahim&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1989). It is caught by handline and as bycatch in traps off Abu Dhabi in low numbers. Total landings show an overall decreasing trend over a period of eight years, however, there is some question about the accuracy of these statistics and no stock assessments are available (2005: 28, 15, 19, 31, 1, 0.5, 0.6 mt; 2012:4 mt) (S. Hartmann pers. comm. 2013). This species is part of a group that is directly targeted by handline and gill net off Saudi Arabia where large catches occur regularly. Landings data are available for this group, however, species-specific data are not available (A. Quassi pers. comm. 2013). It is not an important commercial species off Kuwait, Bahrain, and Iran (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013). Total capture production in&#160;Abu Dhabi fisheries has been in decline since 2005.

The stock does not appear depleted, but a formal stock assessment would be beneficial (James 2014).

As ‘amberjacks nei’ catch in Mexico is comprised of multiple species, including <em>S. rivoliana </em>and <em>S. peruana</em>, more information is needed to understand the proportion that this species comprises. Spikes in catch may be explained by favourable&#160;environmental conditions, and do not necessarily reflect increased effort.</p>  There are two stocks of yellowtail off Baja and southern California; one occurs south of Cedros Island, Baja California, while the second occurs from Cedros northward (CDFG 2001). Since there is limited mixing between the two stocks, the southern California fishery is dependent on recruits from the northern population. In California, commercial landings of yellowtail fluctuated greatly in the past, ranging from a peak of 11.5 million pounds in 1918 to a low of 9,769 pounds in 1995. Market conditions appear to dictate landings more than does the health of the resource (CDFG 2001). During warm water years, the recreational commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fishery landed over 450,000 fish, but when the water was cold, catches were sometimes less than 10,000 fish. In the 1950's, private boaters began taking a significant number of fish, sometimes even more than the CPFV fishery. In 1997, private boat anglers landed 472,000 fish compared to 163,000 by CPFV anglers. Overall, catch rates are high during warm water years due to such conditions being favourable to yellowtail. Though no formal stock assessment has been conducted, according to the California Department of Fish and Game (2001), the California population of yellowtail appears to be stable.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

It is most commonly found at depths of less than 20 meters. This species has been commercially and recreationally targeted throughout its range. Although it no longer supports a commercial fishery, in the wake of World War II, it was heavily marketed as a low-cost alternative to meat during widespread food rationing and became widely appreciated as a delicacy. The fishery expanded, with peak landings declared in the 1960s. Decreases in landings from the 1970s onward are accompanied by widespread concern that <em>S. maculatus</em> populations were being severely reduced by a combination of commercial fishing and environmental degradation of nearshore waters. Whether or not this is actually the case is unclear. Data from a number of fisheries-independent surveys suggest that this species may naturally undergo dramatic fluctuations in abundance throughout its range, and there are several reports of localized increases in abundance which spawned small fisheries.&#160;<em>Sphoeroides maculatus</em>&#160;is still considered a delicacy, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay, and is landed by recreational fishers. This species has never been managed.<br/><br/><strong>Historical Perspective - Commercial Fishery</strong><br/>Food shortages in the wake of World War II led to increased interest in alternative sources of protein, and spawned the development of a number of commercial fisheries. Re-marketed from """"Peasant Fish"""" to """"Sea Squab"""", Northern Puffer fillets appear to have first become popular in New York around 1945, and to have become widely appreciated in the 1960s (based on the plenitude of sea squab recipes in archived newspapers from the period). Coastal fisheries first developed in New York, and later became centred around the mid-Atlantic States and the Chesapeake Bay (McHugh 1972). The discrepancy between the fish's physical appearance and its delectable taste appears to have been a source of much fascination. Due to its high commercial value, scientists became interested in the captive culture and selective breeding of <em>S. maculatus</em> in the laboratory (Valenti 1975). By 1969, two million pounds were being shipped to restaurants up and down the eastern coast of the US, and as far west as Chicago. By the early to mid-1970s Northern Puffer populations were observed to have declined significantly, and the lack of research on wild stocks of the puffer became a cause for concern. It was widely accepted that the upsurge in commercial fishing combined with coastal degradation was causing the observed declines. The commercial fishery for this species appears to have dissolved around this time.<br/><br/><strong>New York - historical fisheries information<br/></strong>Commercial and recreational landings of most finfishes, including&#160;<em>S. maculatus</em>, declined in New York and New Jersey from 1971–1987 despite increasing fishing effort in this region and in most of the United States at the time (McHugh and Hasbrouck 1990). The declines in New York landings correspond to an epizootic of bacterial fin rot in the New York Bight, which affected many species of fish and was attributed to deteriorating water quality (Mohoney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1973).&#160;Alternatively, the decrease in puffer landings was also attributed to the development of the Chesapeake Bay Fishery, which caused a large drop in prices (McHugh 1969).&#160;Population declines in the bays along the eastern portion of Long Island have been attributed to over-fishing, the decline of pound-net fishing, and natural causes. The rise in the 1963 to 1964 commercial landings from New York was attributed to actual increases in abundances, as substantiated by sport fishery studies (Briggs 1965). Another such peak in landings is evident in recreational landings, which peak dramatically in 1991 (1,200,000 individuals) before returning to baseline levels of between 50,000 and 100,000 individuals. In the main channel of the Hudson River, a heavily-modified tidal estuary, this species is currently considered rare (Daniels&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/><strong>Summary of FAO landing statistics</strong><br/>Landings of&#160;<em>S. maculatus&#160;</em>are reported from the Northwest Atlantic Fishing zone, primarily by the United States. The overall trend in landings was one of increase to a peak of 5893 tonnes in 1965, followed by a steep decline to only 300 tonnes five years later, in 1970. By 1974, only three tonnes were reported to have been landed. Landings throughout the 1970s remained low, and increased slightly in the early 1990s to a second peak of 238 tonnes, in 1991. Landings then decreased to 22 tonnes in 2010.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Data from Recreational Fisheries&#160;</strong><br/>The Northern Puffer no longer supports large-scale commercial fisheries. However, it is taken in recreational fisheries. In 2010, ~64 tonnes were landed by recreational fisheries along the Atlantic coast, in contrast to ~22 tonnes declared to FAO (source: FishStatJ, NOAA recreational fishery statistics time series). Trends in recreational landing statistics appear to roughly mirror trends in landing statistics declared to FAO&#160;—&#160;peaks in landings in the late 80s-early 90s are evident in both datasets, as are secondary peaks in landings seen in the mid 2000s.<br/><br/>The large majority of<em> S. maculatus</em> declared in recreational landings originate in state waters (within three to five miles from shoreline), as opposed to in the Federal EEZ of the United States. The overall trend in recreational landings from 1982–2011 is one of increase to a peak of&#160;2,365,115 individual fish in 1992. Declared landings then decrease to 194,298 individuals in 2004, before increasing to 1,635,327 individuals in 2011. These trends are driven by landings declared in the Mid- and South- Atlantic States (from New York to Florida). In 2011, the largest declared recreational landings originated from New Jersey (873,460 individuals), North Carolina (492,489 individuals in 2011), and Virginia (181,951 individuals). Within the Mid-Atlantic, trends are variable through time—in the mid-1990s, landings from New York were dominant (declared 110,4921 fish). It is worth noting that recreational landings in the Northern States (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut), have decreased continuously: 10,584 individuals in 1981, 941 individuals in 2010 (~90% decrease) (NOAA recreational fishery statistics time series).<br/><strong><br/>Fishery-Independent Data</strong><br/><strong>Chesapeake Bay<br/></strong>In the mainstream of the Chesapeake Bay,&#160;<em>S. maculatus</em>&#160;is principally caught from May to October. This species has exhibited declines in abundance indices from 1988 to 2007 following a peak in the 1980s. Recruitment appears to have continuously declined in the Bay during 1993–2003, from 0.84 fish/haul in 1988 to 0.10 fish/haul in 1994 (Fabrizio and Tuckey 2008). Reporting of the Northern Puffer abundance index was eliminated from the Virginia VIMS Juvenile Fish Trawl Survey, a fisheries independent survey program, from 1991–1995 due to low catches (Tuckey and Fabrizio 2009). Biomass Indices are available from 2002–2012, trends in abundance of <em>S. maculatus</em> in the coastal Atlantic appear variable, with occasional peaks in abundance. The Chesapeake Bay experiences large peaks in the abundance of <em>S. maculatus</em> at intervals which are more frequent than those seen in either NEAMap or NFSC Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey Data.&#160;<p><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>An analysis of Northeast Fisheries Science Center Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey Data, collected between 1967 to 1988, suggest that this species may have been more abundant at the beginning of the time series (Gabriel 1992). A more recent examination of these data do not show any spatial or temporal trends in abundance, which fluctuates. Northeast Fisheries Science Center Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey data show the centre of distribution for<em>&#160;S. maculatus</em>&#160;is between the states of New Jersey and North Carolina.&#160;The average number of individuals captured per trawl between 1963 and 2012 between Cape Hatteras and Nova Scotia was five, at an average depth of 22 meters. Although there are occasional captures in excess of 100 individuals, there was no apparent spatial trend in the distribution of these large captures. There is no overall trend in the abundance of <em>S. maculatus </em>taken in this survey; the abundance of this species in captures appears to fluctuate over time, without any clear patterns.</p><p>There is no long-term trend in the abundance of this species indicated from NEAMap Data, which surveys the Atlantic Inshore waters from Cape Cod, MA south to Cape Hatteras, NC. Abundance appears to fluctuate at irregular intervals, and the center of distribution which was evident from the Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey data is mirrored.</p><strong>Other population information</strong><br/><em>Sphoeroides maculatus</em> appears to undergo large-scale, geographically variable fluctuations in abundance: a 15 km stretch of the surf zone along the Northern New Jersey shoreline was sampled every two weeks by beach seine in the late summers and early falls of 1995–1999. <em>Sphoeroides maculatus,&#160;</em>ranging in size from 6–65 mm (mean size 20 mm) were&#160;found to occur irregularly, occurring in relatively large numbers some years (160+) and being completely absent from sampling other years (Wilber<em> et al.</em>&#160;2003). In the late 1980s in the coastal waters of Maryland,&#160;<em>S. maculatus&#160;</em>became extremely abundant, resulting in a local-scale fishery. This increased abundance appeared to corresponded to an increase in&#160;serpulid worm populations (Hall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;The rise in the 1963 to 1964 commercial landings from New York was attributed to actual increases in abundances, as substantiated by sport fishery studies (Briggs 1965). Although population decreases cannot be directly correlated with habitat loss, the global degradation of seagrass beds is causing a reduction in preferable habitat for this fish, possibly lowering its numbers even further.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The latter catch large numbers of pups and juveniles in some regions. The species' aggregating habit makes them vulnerable to capture in large schools. This also means that they may appear more abundant in landings, where they are caught in high, localised concentrations. Intense fishing pressure can deplete regional stocks rapidly, and re-colonization of depleted areas from neighboring regions is expected to be a slow and complex process. This species is expected to have a low resilience to exploitation because of its life-history characteristics (Maguire <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>This species' fins are highly valued and they are being increasingly targeted in some areas in response to increasing demand for shark fins. Hammerhead shark species <em>S. zygaena</em> and <em>S. lewini</em> were found to represent at least 4-5% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading center (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Hammerhead shark fins are generally high value compared to other species because of their high fin ray count (S. Clarke unpubl. data). It is estimated that between 1.3 and 2.7 million <em>S. zygaena</em> or <em>S. lewini</em> are represented in the shark fin trade each year or, in biomass, 49,000 to 90,000 mt (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006b).<br/><br/><strong>Northwest and Western Central Atlantic</strong> (including Caribbean Sea)<br/>In the USA this species is caught in both commercial coastal shark bottom longline and gillnet fisheries and the pelagic longline fishery, where it suffers high mortality (Piercy <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is also taken in recreational shark fisheries. The USA pelagic longline fishery has operated since the 1960s and encompasses the entire range of this species in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, from the equator to about 50°N. Although this is quite a fecund shark, its late age at maturity in this region (15 years) will render it quite vulnerable to overexploitation, and limit its recovery potential.<br/><br/>Estimates of trends in abundance of <em>Sphyrna</em> spp. are available from standardized catch rate indices of the U.S.A. pelagic longline fishery, from logbook data between 1986 and 2000 and from observer data between 1992 and 2005. The area covered by this fishery, ranging from the equator to about 50°N, encompasses the range of this species in these two regions. Although this fishery will not sample individuals closest to the coast, the sample size of hammerheads recorded in the logbook data (the majority of which are thought to be <em>S. lewini</em>) is substantial, with over 60,000 recorded during this period. This subpopulation of Scalloped Hammerhead sharks is estimated from the logbook data to have declined by 89% over the 15 year time period, from 1986-2000 (Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003), which is less than one generation. A more recent analysis of the pelagic longline observer data indicates that <em>Sphyrna</em> spp. declined by 76% between 1992 and 2005 (Baum <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The pelagic longline fishery has operated in these regions since the 1960s, thus declines from 1986 were certainly not from virgin population abundance.<br/><br/>Using logistic regression of <em>S. lewini</em>, Ha (2006) showed that the probability of capture in a fisheries independent sampling program off Virginia, USA, declined by an order of magnitude between 1975 and 2005. Species-specific trends in abundance are available for <em>S. lewini</em> from a shark-targeted longline survey conducted annually between 1972 and 2003 near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, by Dr. F.J. Schwarz at the University of North Carolina. Standardized CPUE from this research survey based on a sample size of 495 <em>S. lewini</em> indicates that it has declined by 98% over this 32 year time period (Myers <em>et al</em>. 2007). Off southern Carolina, Ulrich (1996) reported a 66% decrease between 1983/84 and 1991/95. In contrast to all other data, a more recent research survey (1989-2005) along the southeast U.S. coast shows a significant increase in juvenile scalloped hammerheads (Myers <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Off the Atlantic coast of Belize hammerheads were fished heavily by longline in the 1980s and early 1990s (R.T. Graham pers. obs. 2006). Hammerheads are a favoured target species for their large fins. Interviews with fishermen indicate that the abundance and size of Sphyrnids has declined dramatically in the past 10 years as a result of over exploitation, leading to a halt in the Belize based shark fishery (R.T. Graham pers. obs. 2006). However, the pressure is still sustained by fishers driving into Belizean waters from Guatemala (R.T. Graham pers. obs. 2006). Fin prices are rising above US$50/lb in the neighbouring countries of Guatemala, driven by Asian buyers, according to these interviews (R.T. Graham pers. obs). This species is probably caught in other fisheries but is usually placed in a combined """"hammerhead"""" category. Species identification (<em>S. mokarran</em> vs. <em>S. lewini</em>) is a large obstacle in the proper assessment of this species. The high at-vessel fishing mortality for both species of hammerhead makes the threat of fishing high. <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> is also taken in various fisheries along the Caribbean coast of South America. It is taken in artisanal gillnet fisheries targeting mackerel off Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and in pelagic tuna fisheries of the eastern Caribbean (Chan A Shing 1999). <br/><br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong><br/>The Scalloped Hammerhead faces two main threats related to fisheries in this region: 1) fishing of juveniles and neonates on the continental shelf by gillnets and trawl nets (Vooren and Lamónaca 2003, Kotas and Petrere 2002, Doño 2008); and 2) fishing of adults by gillnets (only in Brazil) and longlines on the continental shelf and oceanic waters, mostly for fins (Kotas <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kotas and Petrere 2002, Kotas and Petrere 2003, Zerbini and Kotas 1998). The species therefore faces intensive fishing pressure throughout its range in this area and at all points in its life cycle. Because all Brazilian fisheries statistics for hammerhead sharks are grouped under the headings """"shark"""" or """"hammerhead shark"""", it is not possible to determine species-specific trends. Annual landings of hammerhead sharks (six species of hammerhead sharks occur off Brazil) in the ports of Rio Grande and Itajaí (Brazil) combined increased rapidly from ~30 t in 1992 to 700 t in 1994, after which catches decreased, fluctuating between 100-300 t from 1995-2002. The majority of this catch was taken by surface gillnet fisheries that targeted hammerhead sharks on the outer shelf and slope between 27° and 35°S (Kotas 2004, Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005). Neonates and small juveniles are caught in coastal waters by directed gillnet fishing and as bycatch by bottom trawls (Vooren and Klippel 2005). In the inshore nursery area (depths down to 10 m), neonates are fished intensively by coastal gillnets and are also caught as bycatch by shrimp trawl, pair trawl and intensive recreational fisheries. Their abundance in coastal waters has decreased markedly as a result (Haimovici and Mendonça 1996, Kotas <em>et al.</em> 1995, 1998, Kotas and Petrere 2002, Vooren and Lamónaca unpublished data). Finning of hammerhead sharks, with discarding of the carcasses at sea, is often practised (Kotas 2004, Vooren and Klippel 2005). Fisheries statistics only refer to the landed carcasses and therefore the true extent of catches is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Brazil and northern Uruguay, adult hammerhead catches (<em>S. lewini </em>and <em>S. zygaena</em>) by monofilament longliners are highest in winter and spring at the shelf edge and the continental slope between 30° and 35°S (Kotas and Petrere 2002). The Brazilian pelagic fishery based in Santos catches significant numbers of sharks, including <em>S. lewini</em> (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 1998). Until 1997, most of this shark catch was discarded but greater demand for fins and flesh has resulted in a substantial increase in retention rates and targeting of sharks (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). Because hammerhead shark fins are highly valued for their high fin-ray count, this species is unlikely to be released alive. The artisanal fishing fleet in São Paulo has operated since 1996 and also takes sharks. The majority of the hammerheads caught by this fishery were newborns or juveniles (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Uruguay (oceanic coast) some neonates are also captured (together with <em>S. zygaena</em>) in artisanal gill nets, in summer (between December and February) (A. Domingo pers. obs. 2007). In view of the intensive fisheries in the coastal and offshore areas where <em>S. lewini</em> occurs in this region and documented declining trends where the species has been heavily fished in other areas of its range, the species is assessed as Vulnerable in the Southwest Atlantic.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central Atlantic</strong><br/>Data to indicate trends in abundance are generally not available for the Eastern Central Atlantic. Zeeberg <em>et al.</em> (2006) suggest that similar population trends for hammerheads (grouped) to those documented in the Northwest Atlantic can be expected in the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic because longline fleets in this area exert comparable fishing effort, and effort is seen to shift from western to eastern Atlantic waters (Buencuerpo <em>et al.</em> 1998, Serafy <em>et al.</em> 2004, Zeeberg <em>et al.</em> 2006). European industrial freeze trawlers targeting small pelagic fish (Sardinella, sardine, and horsemackerel) operate on the northwestern African shelf nearly year-round with five to ten large vessels (9,000-18,000 horse power). A study of bycatch rates in more than 1,400 trawl sets off Mauritania from 2001-2005, showed that <em>Sphyrna</em> species combined represented 42% of total bycatch during this period (Zeeberg <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Hammerheads are caught by both inshore artisanal fisheries and offshore European fisheries operating along the coast of western Africa. The Subregional workshop for sustainable management of sharks and rays in West Africa, 26-28 April 2000 in St Louis, Senegal (Anonymous 2000) noted the high threat to sharks in the West African region and a noticeable decline in the CPUE of total sharks and rays. Walker <em>et al.</em> (2005) also noted that there is concern for <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> off Mauritania, with catches comprised exclusively of juveniles, often newborn. Increased targeting of sharks began in the 1970s, when a Ghanaian fishing community settled in the Gambia and established a commercial network throughout the region, encouraging local fishermen to target sharks for exportation to Ghana. By the 1980s many fishermen were specialising in catching sharks, resulting in a decline in overall shark populations (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). There has been rapid growth in the shark fin market in this region, for export to the Far East, and yearly production of dried fins exported from Guinea-Bissau alone is estimated at 250 t (dry weight) (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>This species is frequently caught along the western African coast and is heavily targeted by driftnets and fixed gillnets from Mauritania to Sierra Leone (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). There is anecdotal evidence for some declines in catches off Senegal and Gambia (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). Juveniles are very susceptible to coastal fisheries using drift or fixed gill nets such as sole, sciaenid and Sepia spp fisheries (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). They were taken as bycatch in the milk shark fishery and in the Banc d'Aguin national park, Mauritania, until the fishery was stopped in 2003 and they are still caught in large quantities in the Sciaenid fishery. A specialized artisanal fishery for carcharhinid and sphyrnid species was introduced in Sierra Leone in 1975, and since then fishing pressure has been continuous (M. Seisay pers. obs. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Western Indian Ocean</strong><br/>Reliable species-specific catch information is available for shark nets set off the beaches of Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, in the southewestern Indian Ocean, from 1978-2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). Catch per unit effort of <em>S. lewini </em>declined significantly during this period from approximately 5.5/km net/year to approximately 2/km net/year (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). This fishery independent data indicates a decline of approximately 64% over a 25 year period. About 120 longline vessels were reportedly operating illegally in coastal waters of the western Indian Ocean prior to 2005, and this number was expected to increase (IOTC 2005). These vessels are primarily targeting hammerhead sharks and Giant Guitarfish (<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) for their fins (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). Illegal fishing by industrial vessels and shark finning are reported in other areas of the Indian Ocean also (Young <em>et al. </em>2006). Dudley and Simpfendorfer (2006) also report large catches of newborn <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> by prawn trawlers on the Tudela Bank, South Africa, ranging from an estimated 3,288 in 1989 to 1,742 in 1992, with almost 98% mortality. An inshore, artisanal fishery that uses multiple gear types (including seine nets and gillnets) along the coast of Mozambique and takes sharks as bycatch also potentially affects <em>S. lewini</em> (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006).<br/><br/><em>Sphyrna lewini</em> is captured in various other fisheries throughout the rest of its range in the Indian Ocean. Few species-specific data are available from other areas, however, declines are also likely to have occurred in other areas where this species is heavily fished. Other countries with major fisheries for sharks include the Maldives, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles and United Republic of Tanzania (Young <em>et al.</em> 2006). Sharks are considered fully to over-exploited in these waters (Young <em>et al.</em> 2006). Landings data are available from FAO for Oman since 1985. <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> is one of five dominant species in the catches of Oman. Landings of sharks for Oman varied between 2,800-8,300 t, since 1985, with peaks noted from 1986-1988 and 1995-1997. After 1997 landings continued to decline to under 4,000 t in 2000 (FAO 2008). Oman has a long-established traditional shark fishery (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007). Henderson <em>et al.</em> (2007) surveyed landings sites in Oman between 2002 and 2003 and report a notable decline in catches of <em>S. lewini</em> in 2003, although the trend varied between areas. Henderson <em>et al.</em> (2007) note that large pelagic sharks such as <em>S. lewini</em> were displaced during 2003 by smaller shark species. Although it is possible that this is due to sampling bias, informal interviews with fishermen revealed a general trend of declining shark catches over the last number of years, particularly large pelagic species (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007). Artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries also target sharks off Madagascar for their fins, which are exported in the international shark fin trade. A study of directed shark fisheries at two sites in southwest Madagascar from 2001-2002 showed that hammerhead sharks represented 29% of sharks caught and 24% of the total wet weight, but species-specific data are not available because fishermen do not differentiate between <em>S. lewini </em>and <em>S. zygaena</em> (McVean <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is also high in other areas of the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, with many countries in this region among the largest shark fishing nations in terms of global catch in the world (Clarke and Rose 2005, SEAFDEC 2006). Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan fishery in the world, with a reported 105,000 and 118,000 tonnes landed in 2002 and 2003 respectively (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). This species is a target and bycatch of shark longline, tuna gillnet fisheries and trawls in several areas of this region (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, SEAFDEC 2006). The species is utilised for its fins (high value in adults), meat, skin and cartilage (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, SEAFDEC 2006). White <em>et al.</em> (2008) suggest that this species is prone to overfishing in Indonesian waters, where substantial catches of <em>S. lewini</em> are taken in gillnet and longline fisheries. They found that almost all of the <em>S. lewini </em>caught by gillnetting, and the majority caught by longlining, were immature, and were therefore removed from the population before they had the opportunity to breed. Inshore fishing pressure is intense throughout Southeast Asia and juveniles and neonates are very heavily exploited, with large numbers of immature sharks in catches in other areas also (SEAFDEC 2006). Foreign vessels are also reported to target sharks in eastern Indonesian waters (Clarke and Rose 2005). Given the marked declines in this species' abundance in areas for which data are available, there is every reason to suspect that declines have also occurred in other areas of the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, where fishing pressure is high.<br/><br/>Japanese data on hammerhead species are limited, but reported landings in Japan's coastal ports totaled 11-34 mt annually between 2000 and 2004 with an average of 24 mt per annum.  No CPUE trends are available (Japan Fisheries Agency 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific</strong><br/>Throughout this species' range in the Eastern Pacific, juveniles and neonates are heavily exploited in directed fisheries, and are also taken as bycatch of shrimp trawlers and coastal fisheries targeting teleost fish. Fishing pressure directed at juveniles also appears to have increased in parts of the Gulf of California and in Costa Rica, and is likely to be increasing elsewhere as other, more valuable fishery stocks are depleted. Patchy distribution resulting from aggregating behavior of adults and the use of historic nurseries, where neonates shoal with spatially confined movements, make this species particularly easy to target. As in other areas, the large fins of this species are highly prized for their value in the international shark fin trade. Increased fishing pressure from international longline fleets in the Eastern Central Pacific and Southeast Pacific, driven by increasing demand for fins, is of concern. Furthermore, as traditional and coastal fisheries in Central America are depleted, domestic fleets have increased pressure at adult aggregating sites such as Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), or along the slopes of the continental shelf where high catch rates of juveniles can be obtained (Vargas and Arauz 2001).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of California, <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> is a common catch in the directed artisanal elasmobranch fisheries of Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California, and Baja California Sur, Mexico. Juveniles, including neonates, dominate the overall landings of this species; most are less than 100 cm total length (Bizzarro <em>et al.</em> in press). Bottom set gillnets and longlines produce the majority of the catch. Adults are landed in artisanal pelagic longline and gillnet fisheries, but represented less than 20% of the total <em>S. lewini</em> observed in artisanal catches during 1998 and 1999 fisheries surveys (Bizzarro <em>et al.</em> In Press). The indirect take by trawlers and artisanal teleost and shrimp fishermen is unknown. Landings data for 1996-1998 from the Gulf of Tehauntepec, Mexico, indicates that Scalloped Hammerheads were the second most important shark caught in the artisanal shark fishery, representing 36% of the total catch from a sample of 8,659 individuals (Soriano-Velassquez  <em>et al.</em> 2002). The size of the individuals in this sample is unknown. Marquez (2000) reports that this species represented only 4.61% of the total catch of the artisanal fishery in the Gulf of California, contrasting with reports for Sinaloa, Mexico in 1994, 1995 and 1996, in which scalloped hammerheads represented 80.3%, 52.54% and 85.68% of the shark catch respectively (Marquez 2000). Off Pacific Guatemala, the importance of this species in the fishery landings appears to vary across areas, from 6% (n=339) to 74% (n=800) of the total catch from 1996-1999 (Ruiz and Ixquiac 2000). Data from El Salvador collected from July of 1991 to June of 1992, indicate this species represented 11.9% of the landed catch in a sample of 412 (Villatoro and Rivera 1994).<br/><br/>The number of adult individuals at a well-known <em>S. lewini</em> aggregation site in the Gulf of California (Espiritu Santo seamount) has declined sharply since 1980. In 1981 Klimley and Nelson estimated the size of a school at 525 individuals using Lincon Index mark recapture methods. Between 1998 and 2004 at least 20 attempts have been made to recreate this study, however in most cases fewer than 8 individuals have been observed at one time (Klimley 1999, Klimley and Jorgensen unpublished data).<br/><br/>Large hammerheads were formerly abundant in coastal waters off Central America, but were reportedly depleted in the 1970s (Cooke 1990). Industrial longlining initiated in the early 1980s, and again large hammerheads provided valuable fins for this market. A comparison of standardized catch rates of pelagic sharks (species-specific information was not available) in the EEZ of Costa Rica from 1991-2000 showed a decrease of 60% (Arauz <em>et al.</em> 2004). In 1991, sharks formed 27% of the total catch. In 2000, only 7.64% of the total catch was sharks, and in 2003 this decreased further to 4.9% of the total catch, 58.2% (Arauz <em>et al.</em> 2004). In 2001 and 2003, scalloped hammerheads only constituted 0.14% and .09% of the total catch by individuals, respectively.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, catch records (grouped for the entire family Sphyrnidae) indicate a peak of approximately 1,000 tons in 1996, followed by a steady reduction until 2001 (Herrera <em>et al.</em> 2003). Landings in the port of Manta (accounting for 80% of shark landing in Ecuador) of <em>S. lewini</em>, caught by artisanal longline and drift net fleet were about 160 t in 2004, 96 t in 2005 and 82 t (2006). Artisanal fishery landings into the port of Manta for <em>Sphyrna</em> spp declined by 51% between 2004 and 2006 (Martínez-Ortíz <em>et al. </em>2007). According to Carrera-Fernández and Martínez-Ortíz (2007) the percentage of juveniles in landings is 83% for females and 71% for males. Most of the landings for this species (74%) take place between January and June.<br/><br/>Divers and dive guides in the Galapagos have noted a severe decrease in shark numbers and schools of hammerhead sharks (P. Zarate pers. comm.). Illegal fishing around the Galapagos is not only practiced by fishermen from the Galapagos, but also by the industrial and artisanal fleet from continental Ecuador and international fleets (Coello 2005). These illegal fisheries target sharks for their fins. There are no species specific data for these fisheries, but <em>S. lewini </em>is one of the most common species around the Galapagos (J. Martinez pers.obs.), and given the high value of fins of this species, it is very likely that it is targeted in illegal finning activities. In an effort to help stopping the illegal finning occurring in the Galapagos, the Ecuadorian Government issued Decree 2130 in 2004 prohibiting fin export from Ecuador. Unfortunately, the Decree had the reverse effect of establishing illegal trade routes, with fins being exported mainly via Peru and Colombia where there is no finning ban in place. Interviews with fishermen and traders in both Ecuador and Peru suggested that illegal trade routes operated for fins transported both from Ecuador and directly from Galapagos to Peru (Saenz 2005, WildAid 2005). Ecuador then abolished Decree 2130 and issued two new Decrees (482 and 902) in 2007 which establish better controls; traceability of the exported products; re-confirm the prohibition of finning established in 1993; a database on trade and establish as State policy the National Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Ecuadorian Sharks (PAT - Ec).<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><br/>There has been a large increase in illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in northern Australia in the last few years (J. Stevens pers. obs.). Several initiatives are underway to identify which species are being taken and in what quantities. Hammerheads are known to feature in the catches, and are suspected targets for their large valuable fins, although no specific data are available. Some domestic boats are also suspected to be targeting species for their fins in the Northern Territory, and this likely includes hammerheads. There is an urgent need to obtain data to form an accurate assessment of the population in this region.","Scalloped hammerhead is a member of the family Sphyrnidae, which is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. States are urged to cooperate over the management of these species. No such management yet exists. Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is urgently needed for this highly migratory species. It is also essential to improve and sustain data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Listing on international resource management agreements, such as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) could help to drive improvements in national and regional management and facilitate collaboration between states, for this species and other migratory sharks.<br/><br/>The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia), regional entities (EU) and regional fisheries organisations (e.g., ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) is accelerating and should increasingly prevent the capture of oceanic sharks for their fins alone.<br/><br/>Management plans, fishing regulation, and monitoring programs are needed throughout this species' range.<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Atlantic</strong> (including Caribbean Sea)<br/>In the U.S. this species is included in the Large Coastal Shark complex management unit, on U.S. Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (National Marine Fisheries Service: Federal Fisheries Management Plan for Atlantic Tuna, Swordfish and Sharks). There are, however, no management measures specific to this species, and no stock assessments. Efforts to limit catches of this species, and increased monitoring of incidental catches in commercial fisheries are both recommended.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong><br/>In Brazil, there are laws restricting the length of pelagic gillnets and banning trawl fishing at a distance of less than three nautical miles from shore (equivalent depths of less than about 10 m), however enforcement of these laws has been difficult. Therefore trawling in inshore nursery grounds has continued and gillnetting within nursery areas is not regulated. Some fisheries along the coast are poorly documented and the multi-species nature of many of the fisheries makes species-specific regulation very difficult. Therefore, it is recommended that coastal protected sea areas are established, in which fishing is banned, to protect nursery grounds.<br/><br/>In 1998, the Brazilian Government's Environmental Agency (IBAMA - Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Natural Renewable Resources) made a first effort to control """"finning"""" by issuing a federal regulation (Portaria IBAMA nnordm; 121 of August 24th, 1998), prohibiting shark finning by all vessels licensed to fish in Brazilian waters (Kotas <em>et al.</em> 2002). The enforcement of this law has been proven difficult and probably will require international financial aid, trained personnel for sampling work along the main fishing harbours and the establishment of a national observer program (Kotas <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific</strong><br/>There are no species-specific measures in place for <em>S. lewini</em> in the Eastern Pacific, although steps are being taken towards the management of elasmobranch fisheries. In Ecuador the current regulations prohibit shark fishing in the core zone of the Galápagos marine reserve, however extensive poaching has been reported. Ecuador issued two new Decrees (482 and 902) in 2007 which establish better controls; traceability of the exported products; re-confirm the prohibition of finning established in 1993; a database on trade and establish as State policy the National Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Ecuadorian Sharks (PAT - Ec). In Mexico, some known adult aggregating sites are protected within the Revillagigedo Island archipelago, however enforcement is lacking and there are many reports of poaching. Protection of known nursery adult aggregating sites is recommended. Estimates of acceptable catch rates should be viewed with precaution until there is more certainty in age and growth parameters.<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><br/>Although Australian fisheries are generally well-managed, the recent increase in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing vessels in the waters of northern Australia is of concern for this species.",Unknown,"Recent studies indicate that the Northwest Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic populations of this species are each genetically distinct from each other, and from Eastern Central Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations (D. Chapman and M. Shivji, Nova Southeastern University unpublished data). The boundaries between each population are not yet completely defined due to sampling constraints, but the """"Caribbean Sea"""" population includes Belize and Panama and the """"U.S. Gulf Of Mexico"""" sample covers from Texas to south-western Florida, the boundary or transition zone will be in between Texas and Northern Belize (D. Chapman and M. Shivji, Nova Southeastern University pers. comm. 2007). Further studies are planned to obtain more samples from the Caribbean Sea.

Due to the great hammerhead?s preference for warmer waters, it can be expected to make up a greater proportion of tropical catches of hammerheads than more temperate fisheries. <em>Sphyrna mokarran</em> is taken by target and bycatch, fisheries (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Zeeberg <em>et al</em>. 2006) and is regularly caught in the tropics, with longlines, fixed bottom nets, hook-and-line, and possibly with pelagic and bottom trawls (Compagno in prep). Hammerhead sharks, <em>S. mokarran</em> in particular, have been noted as a favoured target species due to the size of their fins (R.T. Graham pers. comm). Fin prices are rising, driven by the Asian Fin market (R.T. Graham pers. obs). <br/> <br/>There was a directed shark fishery operated by Taiwan around the northern coast of Australia that regularly caught great hammerheads up until 1986 (Stevens and Lyle 1989). Other possible threats include sport fishing (Pepperell 1992) and capture in anti-shark measures around the beaches of Australia and South Africa (Paterson 1990, Cliff 1995). Bonfil (1994) gives an overview of global shark fisheries. This species is mentioned specifically with reference to fisheries in Brazil, East USA and Mexico, however <em>Sphyrna</em> spp. are mentioned in the majority of tropical fisheries cited. <br/> <br/><strong>West Africa</strong> <br/>Mainly taken by drift gillnets, bottom gillnets and on longlines, hook and line, pelagic and bottom trawls (Schneider 1990). This species is a bycatch in both the industrial and artisanal fisheries but a specialised artisanal fishery for charcharhinid and sphyrnid species was introduced in Sierra Leone in 1975, and since then fishing pressure has not decreased (M. Seisay pers. obs). The Subregional workshop for sustainable management of sharks and rays in West Africa, 26-28 April 2000 in St Louis, Senegal (Ducrocq 2002) noted the high threat to sharks in the west African region and a noticeable decline in the CPUE of total sharks and rays. This workshop identified <em>S. mokkarran </em>as particularly threatened. The subsequent sub-regional plan of action for sharks of West Africa (member states of the Sub Regional Fishing Commission) states that landings of <em>S. mokarran</em> have collapsed and lists this as one of the four most threatened species, deserving the greatest attention in the whole region (Ducrocq 2002). <br/> <br/>Previously observed from Mauritania to Angola, reportedly abundant from November to January in Senegal, and in October in Mauritania (Cadenat and Blache 1981). However, recent scientific trawl surveys off Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Conakry between 20 to 1,000 m have failed to record it, except in very low numbers off Guinea-Conakry and one record from Senegal in 1995 (FISA unpublished data). Anecdotal evidence from interviews with fishermen in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea suggest there was a large decline in all shark species during the 1990s and that <em>S. mokarran</em> is almost extirpated from these areas (M. Ducrocq pers. obs.).   <br/> <br/>Data are lacking as there is little species specific data collection in the region, however this is a very distinctive species with a large dorsal fin which is highly valued for the shark fin trade. Increased targeting of sharks began in the 1970s, when a Ghanaian fishing community settled in the Gambia and established a commercial network throughout the region, encouraging local fishermen to target sharks for exportation to Ghana. By the 1980s many fishermen were specialising in catching sharks, resulting in a decline in overall shark populations (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). There has been rapid growth in the shark fin market in this region, for export to the Far East, and yearly production of dried fins exported from Guinea-Bissau alone is estimated at 250 t (dry weight) (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). <em>Sphyrna</em> species combined represented 42% of bycatch in the European industrial pelagic trawl fishery off Northwest Africa (Zeeberg 2006). <br/> <br/>Although there are very little species specific data available, the absence of recent records and region-wide recognition of the extent of the decline, give cause to suspect that the population has decreased by least 80% in the past 25 years. Fisheries in this region remain largely unmonitored and unmanaged, leading to an assessment of Critically Endangered in the Eastern Atlantic.   <br/> <br/><strong>Southwest Indian Ocean</strong> <br/>This species is widely distributed in the SW Indian Ocean and is a summer migrant to KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) (east coast of South Africa), where the annual catch in the KZN shark nets is 11 sharks (1978 to 1999), consisting mainly of adolescents and adults. Over this period there has been a significant decline in annual catch (18 to 4 sharks) and catch rate (0.5 to 0.2 sharks.km-net<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup> (p = 0.000) (Dudley 2002). A continued decline in catch rate was reported for the period 1978 to 2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). Over this period, regression of catch and catch rate against year revealed a significant decline in annual catch from 18 to two sharks (89%) and in catch rate from 0.44 to 0.09 sharks.km-net<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup> (79%) (S. Dudley pers. obs. 2006). It is uncertain whether these declines reflect highly localized stock depletion or whether they reflect a general decline in the Southwest Indian Ocean, but large numbers of longline vessels have been reported to be operating illegally in coastal waters of the western Indian Ocean where they are targeting primarily hammerhead sharks and giant guitarfish <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em> (IOTC 2005 in Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). This species is generally regarded as solitary, and is therefore unlikely to be abundant wherever it occurs. This is in contrast to other large hammerheads, such as <em>Sphyrna lewini</em> which forms large schools. <em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>, like other hammerheads, readily takes baited hooks and is sought after for its fins. Based on these characteristics, together with the decline of 79% in catch rates in the KZN shark nets, this species is assessed as Endangered in the southwest Indian Ocean. <br/> <br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic</strong> <br/>This species is caught primarily as a bycatch in the pelagic longline, bottom longline and net fisheries along the northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. It is also caught in the recreational fishery. The species represents 0.7% of the species catch and suffers from greater than 90% at-vessel fishing mortality in the U.S. bottom longline fishery (Commercial Shark Fishery Observer Program unpubl. data). The U.S. pelagic fishery logbook data has shown a decline close to 90%, however this data-set is known for inaccurate data reporting (Beerkircher <em>et al.</em> 2002). There is probably a lack of reporting of the catch of great hammerheads because this species is routinely finned and discarded, which is illegal in the US Atlantic Federal Waters (Commercial Shark Fishery Observer Program unpub. data). Both the pelagic and bottom longline observer programs have recorded a 2 to 3:1 ratio for <em>S. Lewini</em> to <em>S. mokarran</em>. The meat is not valuable but the fins are high grade and bring in a good price, thus finning still occurs in the U.S. fishery. Interview with shark fishermen in Belize indicate that hammerheads (<em>S. mokarran</em> in particular) are a favoured target species for their large fins (R.T. Graham pers. obs.). Fin prices are rising above US$50/lb in the neighbouring countries of Guatemala, driven by Asian buyers, according to these interviews (R.T. Graham pers. obs).  This species is probably caught in other fisheries but is usually placed in a combined """"hammerhead"""" category. Species identification (<em>S. mokarran</em> vs. <em>S. lewin</em>i) a large obstacle in the proper assessment of this species. The high at-vessel fishing mortality for both species of hammerhead makes the threat of fishing even greater for this species. In the Pacific Ocean off of Guatemala this species is caught as by-catch in the commercial longline fishery. <br/> <br/>There appear to be little data for landings and catch effort for this species in Central America and the Caribbean. Off the coast of Belize hammerheads were fished heavily by longline in the 1980s and early 1990s. Interviews with fishermen indicate that the abundance and size of Sphyrnids has declined dramatically in the past 10 years as a result of over exploitation, leading to a halt in the Belize based shark fishery (R.T. Graham pers. obs). However, the pressure is still sustained by fishers driving into Belizean waters from Guatemala (R.T. Graham pers. obs). The Cuban directed shark fishery (longline) between 1983 and 1991 recorded <em>S. mokarran</em> (subadults and juveniles) as one of 23 species caught. Since 1992 small increases in mean sizes were noted, indicating partial recovery of the species. In Mexico between November 1993 and December 1994 (Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatan) 901 vessels were monitored every day. <em>Sphyrna mokarran</em> represented 86% of the total catch. <br/> <br/>The difficulty in species identification and accurate recording make an assessment of this species very difficult. However, low survival at capture makes this species very vulnerable to fishing pressure, whether directed or incidental. This species is listed as Endangered in the Northwest Atlantic under criterion A2 based on a suspected decline of at least &gt;50% over the past 10 years. The decline is poorly documented and has not been curtailed. <br/> <br/><strong>Australia</strong> <br/>There has been a large increase in the illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in northern Australia in the last few years (J. Stevens pers. obs.). Several initiatives are underway to identify which species are being taken and in what quantities. Hammerheads are known to feature in the catches, and are suspected targets for their large valuable fins, although no specific data are available. Some domestic boats are also suspected to be targeting species for their fins in the Northern Territory, and this likely includes hammerheads (J. Stevens pers. obs). It is not a productive species and is coming out at the """"high-risk"""" end in recent Risk Assessments of northern Australian elasmobranchs (J. Stevens pers. obs). There is concern that this species is being increasingly targeted, and therefore an urgent need to obtain data to form an accurate assessment of the population in this region.","There are no known species specific conservation measures in place for <em>S. mokarran</em>. <br/> <br/>This species is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which urges States to cooperate over the management of these species. No such management yet exists. Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is urgently needed for this unproductive shark. It is also essential to improve data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. <br/> <br/>The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia), regional entities (EU) and regional fisheries organisations (ICCAT) is accelerating and should increasingly prevent the harvesting of hammerhead sharks for their fins alone. <br/> <br/>In the U.S. this species is managed as a Large Coastal Shark on U.S. Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (National Marine Fisheries Service: Federal Fisheries Management Plan for Atlantic Tuna, Swordfish and Sharks). <br/> <br/>In South Africa there is a shark bycatch limit in the tuna longline fishery of 10% of the weight of tuna landed, and a recreational line fishery Bag Limit of one shark per angler per day.",Decreasing,NA,Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

In Mexican coastal waters, off the Gulf of Mexico, this is the second most important species in the artisanal fisheries accounting for 15% of the landings numerically (Castillo-Géniz <em>et al</em>. 1998). Targeted fisheries for this species have also been documented for Trinidad and Tobago (Shing 1999) and Ecuador (Martinez 1999). Bycatch in other fisheries, mainly from shrimp trawling, is probably also significant in other fishing nations within this species range.<br/><br/>Nursery areas for this species are located inshore and adults frequent inshore waters, making this species vulnerable to exploitation and human-induced habitat degradation. Results of ongoing work on the reproductive endocrinology of this species off Florida’s west coast show that high levels of organochlorine contaminants are present in tissues of sampled individuals; however, there have been no documented indications of resulting physiological impact (Gelsleichter <em>et al</em>. 2005).","<p>In the USA, the Bonnethead Shark is classified as a small coastal species in the Federal Management Plan (FMP) for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, together with the Blacknose Shark (<em>Carcarhinus acronotus</em>), the Finetooth Shark (<em>C. isodon</em>), and the Atlantic Sharpnose (<em>Rhizoprionodon terranovae</em>; NMFS 2006). The Bonnethead Shark has been assessed individually since 2007 and the population in the northwest Atlantic Ocean was determined to be not overfished with no overfishing occurring (SEDAR 2013).<br/></p>",Stable,"Regional estimates of abundance from stock assessment models are available for the United States (South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean) as defined by NOAA Fisheries. In the region, predicted 2011 abundance was ~4.9 million animals, which had remained relatively stable over the past ~25 years (SEDAR 2013). Predicted abundance and spawning stock fecundity show slight depletion from 1950 to 1972, followed by a decreasing trend through the late 1990s, and a progressive increase in the last decade (SEDAR 2013).<br/><br/>At the time of this assessment Bonnethead Sharks in the Gulf of Mexico and western North Atlantic are not considered overfished, and overfishing is not occurring (SEDAR 2013, Frazier <em>et al</em>. 2013a). U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico recreational shark catch estimates from several surveys indicate that about 60,000 Bonnethead Sharks were caught annually from 1981-2011, ranging from a minimum of about 7,000 sharks in 1984 to a peak of about 131,000 sharks caught in 2001 (SEDAR 2013). Additionally, bycatch estimates from the shrimp trawl fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico indicate that about 537,000 individuals were caught annually from 1972-2011 (SEDAR 2013). <br/><br/>United States Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico annual overall catch from 2000-2011 averaged &gt;500,000 individuals (SEDAR 2013). Commercial landings of this species indicate that Bonnethead Shark accounted for over 50% of all landings of small coastal sharks in the southeastern USA in 1995, but was the least important small coastal species of shark represented in commercial landings from 1996-2011. The number of individuals landed commercially averaged about 29,000 sharks annually from 1995-1999, and ~14,000 sharks annually from 2000-2011 (SEDAR 2013).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_not_th

In a review of world elasmobranch fisheries Bonfil (1994) listed <em>S. zygaena</em> as being reported in catches from directed shark fisheries off the east and west coasts of the USA, Brazil, Spain, Taiwan and Philippines. It also is taken in the shark fishery off south-western Australia (Heald 1987) and western Africa (Castro and Mejuto 1995). This shark is undoubtedly caught in shark fisheries in other parts of its range, but has not been reported separately from other hammerhead species. Very often these sharks are finned and the carcasses discarded. Bonfil (1994) also reported that this species is caught as bycatch in a number of non-shark fisheries, particularly pelagic longline and gillnet fisheries that operate close to temperate and subtropical continental shelves (e.g., South Pacific driftnet fishery, Mediterranean drift net fishery, Spanish longline fishery operating in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean tuna longline fishery). The capture of <em>S. zygaena</em> in many of these fisheries is infrequent (Bonfil 1994). Although size data are limited, catches in pelagic fisheries appear to be dominated by larger individuals, while juveniles are common in inshore shelf fisheries.<br/><br/>This species' fins are highly valued and they are being increasingly targeted in some areas in response to increasing demand for shark fins. Hammerhead shark species <em>S. zygaena</em> and <em>S. lewini</em> were found to represent at least 4-5% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading center (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Hammerhead shark fins are generally high value compared to other species because of their high fin ray count (S. Clarke unpubl. data). It is estimated that between 1.3 and 2.7 million <em>S. zygaena</em> and/or <em>S. lewini</em> are represented in the shark fin trade each year or, in biomass, 49,000 to 90,000 mt (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006b).<br/><br/>Catches of Sphyrnidae have been reported only from the Atlantic Ocean since 1991 and these landings are undoubtedly under-reported. The catch was near 2,200 tonnes in 2004 (Maguire <em>et al</em>. 2006). Only <em>S. zygaena</em> and <em>S. lewini</em> are reported as individual species in the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) fisheries statistics, but hammerhead catches are often grouped in one category as, Sphyrna species, which makes identification of actual catches of <em>S. zygaena</em> difficult.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>The Smooth Hammerhead appears to be less common in the central Mediterranean, in comparison to the western regions of this sea. Buencuerpo <em>et al.</em> (1998) reported that 757 specimens were captured during their pelagic longline and gillnet survey from July 1991-July 1992 off southern Spain. Most of these specimens were presumed to be part of the Atlantic population. In the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea this species is mainly caught by longlines and gillnets, particularly as bycatch in tuna and swordfish fisheries. Despite a ban on driftnetting in Mediterranean waters, this practice continues illegally (WWF 2005). A recent study of the Moroccan driftnet fleet operating in the Alboran Sea (southwest Mediterranean) and around the Strait of Gibraltar by Tudela <em>et al.</em> (2005) indicates that pelagic fishing pressure in this area is beyond the reproductive capacity of several other semi-oceanic shark species that were previously caught with <em>S. zygaena</em> (such as Alopias vulpinus). Some of these vessels appear to be increasingly targeting sharks by deploying driftnets closer to shore (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2005). <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> is not mentioned in this study. However, this species was reported in Buencuerpo <em>et al.</em>'<em>s</em> (1998) survey of longline and gillnet landings from the same area in 1992. Buencuerpo <em>et al.</em> (1998) report the highest catches of <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> in the Spanish swordfish fishery from the western African coasts and near the Strait of Gibraltar.<br/><br/>Ferretti <em>et al. </em>(2008) compiled nine time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Of the taxa for which there were enough data to investigate, hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna</em> spp) declined the fastest; they appeared to disappear from coastal waters after 1963 and catches declines consistently in pelagic waters in the early 1980s in all sectors. Meta-analysis showed an average instantaneous rate of decline of -0.17 (CI 95%: -0.34, -0.003; time range 178 years) in abundance and -0.36 (CI 95%: -0.56, -0.16; time range: 107 years) in biomass, which translated into an estimated species decline of 99.99% in both cases. Walker <em>et al.</em> (2005) also report that the species has virtually disappeared from the central-southern Mediterranean Sea since 1986.<br/><br/>Mejuto <em>et al. </em>(2002) estimate landings of 240 tons of <em>Sphyrna</em> spp. And 1.1 ton of <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> in the North Atlantic for the Spanish Surface longline fleet in 1999. De la Serna <em>et al.</em> (2002) reported only eight specimens of <em>S. zyagaena</em> (0.05%) in a total 17,759 sharks caught during a survey of the Spanish Mediterranean Fisheries from 1997-1999. This is significantly lower when compared to results of the same fishery along the west African coast and Iberian peninsula (where 757 specimens in period July 1991-July 1992 were caught). Megalofonou <em>et al.</em> (2000) only recorded four specimens during their survey of shark bycatches and discards in Mediterranean large pelagic fisheries in 1998-1999 (one in the Adriatic, two in the Ionian Sea and one in Spanish Mediterranean waters). There are few recent records of Sphyrna species in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. A total of 16 records of <em>S. zygaena</em> were collected in the eastern Adriatic from the 19th century to the 1950s, including reported catches were distributed throughout whole of the eastern coast. A higher number of records were reported during the 19th century in comparison to the 20th century (10 vs. 6, respectively) and the species has not been reported in this area since 1956 (Soldo and Jardas 2002). Although it occurs in open waters of southern Adriatic, it is only caught very rarely (Bello 1999). There were only 13 records of <em>S. zygaena</em> in the Northern Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Seas from the 1960s-1995 and there are no reports of this species during the last five years (F. Serena pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Atlantic</strong><br/>Longline fleets exert intense fishing pressure throughout the Northwest Atlantic (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). Baum <em>et al. </em>(2003) estimated that hammerhead sharks (grouped data for <em>S. lewini, S. mokarran</em> and <em>S. zygaena</em>) have declined in abundance by 89% since 1986 (95% confidence interval (CI): 86 to 91%) in their analysis of U.S. pelagic longline logbook data. This group is primarily composed of <em>S. lewini</em>; in Virginia Institute of Marine Science sampling programmes since 1973, <em>S. lewini</em> outnumbered <em>S. zygaena</em> by more than ten to one (Ha 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Atlantic</strong><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic <em>S. zygaena</em> faces two main threats related to fisheries: catches of juveniles and pups along the continental shelf by different fishing gears (mainly bottom gillnets and trawlers (Vooren and Lamónaca 2003, Kotas and Petrere 2002, Doño 2008); and adult and juvenile catches by gillnets and longlines throughout the continental shelf and oceanic environments for the international fin market (Kotas <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kotas and Petrere 2002ab, Kotas and Petrere 2003, Zerbini and Kotas 1998, Domingo in prep). The species therefore faces intensive fishing pressure at all points in its life-cycle in this area. Off southern Brazil; from 1983-2005, indices of abundance of neonates of <em>S. zygaena</em> varied from 1-5% of the abundance of those of <em>S. lewini</em> in the same area (Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005). Catches of neonates, juveniles and adults are taken by longline fleets based in Itajaí, which operate along the coast of southern Brazil (Kotas and Petrere 2002). The species is also a known bycatch of domestic, as well as Taiwanese, Japanese and other international longline fishing fleets operating throughout the South Atlantic Ocean (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2005, Matsushita and Matsunaga 2002). Juveniles and adults are also taken as bycatch by longline fleets operating in shelf and oceanic waters off Uruguay and Brazil (200-3000m). Given the declining trends apparent in other areas of the species' range where it is heavily fished, for example the Mediterranean Sea, the population in the Southwest Atlantic may be unable to withstand continued fishing pressure.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific</strong><br/><em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> is taken as both target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries along the eastern Pacific coast of the Americas. Landings of this species in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico have been reported as 1% of the total chondrichthyan catch. Seasonal surveys of fisheries on the eastern coast of Mexico, conducted during 1998-1999, showed that <em>S. zygaena</em> was a common component of the landings of directed shark fisheries. The majority of those landed were juveniles in many areas (Bizzaro <em>et al.</em> 2007). This study reports that large sharks, such as <em>S. zygaena</em> were usually targeted in directed drift gillnet, or to a lesser extent, surface longline fisheries. Márquez-Farías (2000) report an overall decline in catch rates for all shark species in the Gulf of California. This species has also been reported as bycatch in longline, bottom trawl and gillnets in the landings of other Central and South American countries, down to Peru. In Ecuador, <em>S. zygaena</em> represents 11% of the total chondrichthyan landings. There is a high proportion of juveniles in these Ecuadorian landings; 91% of female (measuring S. zygaena represented 12.5% of total chondrichthyan landings over the period 1996-2005 (Romero, M. PANtiburones).<br/><br/>An artisanal fishing fleet targeting sharks south of Tres Marias Islands in the Central Mexican Pacific operated out of La Cruz Huanacaxtle from the early 1990s to 1997, after which they moved to Yavaros in the Central Gulf of California, apparently following the migratory movements of some of the shark species (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2005) monitored the shark landings of this fleet from 1995-1996. <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> was the most important of 10 species recorded in 607 sets taken south of the Tres Marias Islands, composing 35% of 2,004 sharks recorded. This artisanal fleet has not caught sharks south of the Tres Marias Islands or in the Central Gulf of California since the late-1990s (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Illegal fisheries target sharks for their fins around the Galapagos Islands. There are no specific data for these fisheries, but given the high value of its fins, it is very likely that it is targeted in illegal finning activities. Illegal fishing in this area is not only practiced by fishermen from the Galapagos, but also by the industrial and artisanal fleets from continental Ecuador and international fleets (Coello 2005). Divers and dive guides in the Galapagos have noted a severe decrease in shark number and schools of hammerhead sharks (P. Zarate pers comm.). The Ecuadorian Government issued a decree in 2004 prohibiting fin export from Ecuador, in an attempt to help stop illegal finning in the Galapagos. Unfortunately the Decree had the reverse effect of establishing illegal trade routes with fins now being exported mainly via adjacent Peru and Colombia, where there is no regulation banning finning. Interviews within fishermen and traders in both Ecuador and Peru suggest that there are illegal trade routes for fins transported both from continental Ecuador and directly from the Galapagos to Peru, and illegal finning activity is ongoing (Sáenz 2005, WildAid 2005).<br/><br/>Hammerhead sharks, including <em>S. zygaena</em>, are also caught by international purse seine fleets targeting tunas in the high seas of the Eastern Pacific, particularly those associated with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) (Román-Verdesoto and Orozco-Zöller 2005). IATTC conducted a one year species sampling programme to determine the accuracy of identification by fisheries observers on these vessels. <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> was found to represent 1.7% and <em>S. lewini</em>, 3.6% of the sharks recorded during this programme, respectively.<br/><br/><strong>Australia</strong><br/>In the West Australian demersal gillnet fishery <em>Sphyrna zygaena</em> is an important bycatch species, but appears not to be impacted by this low fishing pressure. The species is reasonably abundant around the northern North Island of New Zealand, and the most abundant shark species recorded in aerial surveys along the northwest coast. In New Zealand, neonates and small juveniles are a common bycatch in commercial gillnet fisheries for flatfish, and are also commonly taken by trawlers and Danish seiners. They are usually discarded, although juveniles discarded from gillnets are usually dead. Adults are mainly taken by gamefishers as bycatch when targeting marlin with live baits, and consequently the annual catch is small. Many of the sharks taken by game fishers are released alive (C. Duffy, pers. comm.). <em>S. zygaena</em> is abundant in the region, and significant numbers of adults do not appear to be taken in commercial fisheries.<br/><br/><em>Sphyrna zygaena</em>, along with <em>S. lewini</em> and <em>S. mokarran</em>, are exploited by the commercial line fishery and recreational game fishery off New South Wales. The majority of the hammerhead catch in commercial and recreational fisheries is composed of <em>S. zygaena</em> and <em>S. lewini </em>(Scandol <em>et al.</em> 2008). Total commercial hammerhead landings peaked in 1993/94 at 15/7 t. Annual commercial catches have averaged ~3 t in the last five years. Most hammerhead landings come from the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (74%), but they are also taken in the Estuary General and Ocean Trawl Fisheries.<br/><br/>Information on catches of <em>S. zygaena</em> by recreational anglers is very limited due to the lack of species identification. Total catch of hammerhead sharks by recreational gamefishing and protective beach meshing remained at about 250 sharks per year between the 1970s and 2001, with 95% of recreational gamefishing catches being tagged and released. It is likely that <em>S. zygaena</em> is caught in recreational fisheries off temperate and subtropical coasts. This species has also been reported from nets set in the New South Wales beach protection programme (Krough 1994). This employs large mesh gillnets to catch large sharks as a measure to protect beach users from shark attack. In the New South Wales programme, hammerheads (mostly <em>S. zygaena</em>) made up nearly 50% of the catch of 4,715 sharks in the period from 1972-73 to 1989-90 (Reid and Krough 1992). The large mesh nets used by shark control programmes appear to be very efficient at catching hammerhead sharks, including <em>S. zygaena</em>, while catches are very low on the large baited lines used in some programmes (Simpfendorfer 1993). <br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific</strong><br/>Hammerhead sharks, including <em>S. zygaena</em>, are taken in a variety of artisanal and commercial fisheries in this region as both target and bycatch, however, no reliable species specific data are available because catches tend to be grouped into """"<em>Sphyrna</em> spp."""", if recorded at all. Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). The Spanish swordfish longline fishery, which also targets sharks, is also active across the Indian Ocean (ICCAT 2005). Large hook and line and in mesh gillnet fisheries are known to target sharks off India, where this species occurs (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Finning and discarding of carcasses has also been reported, especially in offshore and high seas fisheries (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). A recent review of fisheries in the Indian Ocean (Young <em>et al.</em> 2006) reported that sharks in this area are considered fully to over-exploited. Large numbers of longline vessels have also been reported to be operating illegally in coastal waters of the western Indian Ocean, primarily targeting hammerhead sharks and giant guitarfish (IOTC 2005, Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006).<br/><br/>Japanese data on hammerhead species are limited, but reported landings in Japan's coastal ports totaled 11-34 mt annually between 2000 and 2004 with an average of 24 mt per annum.  No CPUE trends are available (Japan Fisheries Agency 2006).","Smooth hammerhead is a member of the family Sphyrnidae, which is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. States are urged to cooperate over the management of these species. No such management yet exists. Precautionary adaptive collaborative management of target and bycatch fisheries is urgently needed for this highly migratory species. It is also essential to improve and sustain data collection and develop stock assessments for this species. Listing on international resource management agreements, such as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) could help to drive improvements in national and regional management and facilitate collaboration between states, for this species and other migratory sharks.<br/><br/>The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia, Brazil), regional entities (EU) and regional fisheries organisations (e.g. ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) is accelerating and should increasingly prevent the capture of oceanic sharks for their fins alone. Strict enforcement of these bans is required if they are to be effective.<br/><br/>Management plans, fishing regulation, and monitoring programs are needed throughout this species' range. Estimates of acceptable catch rates should be viewed with precaution until there is more certainty in age and growth parameters and further research on the species' life-history characteristics is required. Protection of known adult aggregation sites and coastal nursery areas is also recommended.<br/><br/>In the USA, this species is included in the Large Coastal Shark complex management unit on the US Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan, however there are no management measures specific to this species and no stock assessments have been undertaken for it. Enforcement of Brazilian laws restricting the length of pelagic gillnets and banning trawl fishing at a distance of less than 3 nm from shore has been difficult and therefore trawling in inshore nursery grounds has persisted.",Decreasing,"Specific data on populations of this species are generally unavailable in many areas because hammerhead shark catches are often grouped to include several <em>Sphyrna</em> species. Furthermore, this species has sometimes been confused with the Scalloped Hammerhead (<em>S. lewini</em>) in the tropics and these two species are probably misidentified with each other.",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

However, all available data suggest that Phylogroup 1 (Atlantic/Western Mediterranean) is exploited sustainably and is in the process of expansion. Subpopulations in the eastern Mediterranean (Phylogroup 2), particularly in the Black Sea, have been over-exploited in the past, leading to stock crashes; however, based on the currently available data, these populations appear to have rebounded, biomass is considered intermediate, and exploitation is considered sustainable.&#160;The North Sea, Skagerrak-Kattegat and Baltic stocks have increased during the last five years due to improved recruitment <span style="""""""">(ICES 2017a; ICES 2018a, ICES 2018b)</span>, while the Norwegian coastal and fjord populations are at a historic low level.<br/><br/><strong>Stock-Specific Information</strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Skagerrak and Kattegat</em><strong> -&#160;</strong>Sprat in division 3a is fished with juvenile herring and the exploitation of sprat has been limited by the restrictions imposed on fisheries for juvenile herring. Sufficient information is lacking to evaluate fishing mortality and Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) of sprat in this region; however, an index of the stock trend indicates substantial (more than an order of magnitude) fluctuations with no trend from 1985 to present.

(ICES 2018a).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Baltic Sea</em> <strong>-&#160;</strong>Division 3d contains the largest fished stock for this species. This stock has experienced large fluctuations (7-8 fold) since 1974. SSB has declined from its peak of 1.9 million tonnes in 1996 to fluctuate around 1 million tonnes since 2000. Sprat is currently considered to be harvested sustainably and at full reproductive capacity, with fishing mortality (F) below and stock biomass above the reference points (<span style="""""""">ICES 2018b</span>).&#160;<br/><br/><em>North Sea</em>&#160;-&#160;The stock in Subarea 4 has experienced substantial fluctuations (more than an order of magnitude) since 1974. Overall, SSB has increased substantially, from a minimum of about 13,000 tonnes in the mid-1980s to about 250,000 tonnes in 2016. Sprat is currently considered to be at full reproductive capacity, with stock biomass above the reference points since <span style="""""""">2013 (ICES 2017a</span>). The increase has been attributed to the depletion of the cod stock (Rijnsdorp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).<br/><br/><em>West of Scotland, southern Celtic Seas</em> - The stock structure in Subarea 6 and divisions 7a-c and 7f-k is not well defined. Sufficient information is not available to evaluate stock trends and exploitation, or to define reference points. Landings in this area have fluctuated since 1960, with a peak of around 25,000 tonnes in the late 1970s; more recent landings have fluctuated around 5,000 tonnes, but were consistently higher than the recommended cap of 3,500 tonnes (decreased to 2,800 tonnes for 2018 and 2019: <span style="""""""">ICES 2017b</span>).<br/><br/><em>English Channel</em> - The relationship between sprat in the Celtic Seas ecoregion (Subarea 6 and divisions 7a-c and 7f-k) and the English Channel (divisions 7d-e) is not well understood. Sprat in divisions 7d-e has not undergone formal stock evaluation due to a lack of sufficient information. Landings from this region have fluctuated from 1985-2016, with peak landings of about 7,000 tonnes in 1992. Current landings have been relatively stable around 3,000 tonnes since the mid-2000s. An acoustic survey (2013-2016) in division 7e has indicated a substantial decline in the biomass index from 2014-2016. Landings have been below the advised precautionary limits and the <span style="""""""">agreed total allowable catch since 2014 (ICES 2017c).</span>&#160;<br/><br/><em>Mediterranean Sea</em> - Information is limited regarding the status of sprat in the Mediterranean Sea. It is not commercially exploited in the northwestern Mediterranean (Saraux <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are no formal stock ass<span style="""""""">essments, and it is a low priority for future stock assessments in the Mediterranean based on a productivity and susceptibility analysis that accounts for the value of landings and susceptibility (STECF 2016). Locally, there are indications of strong fluctuations in the presence and biomass of sprat; for example, sprat declined&#160;in Gulf of Lion from 2003-2007 (J.P. Quignard pers. comm. 2007, Saraux <em>et al</em>. 2014), then rapidly increased to about 70,000 tonnes in 2012 (Saraux&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Since 2008, it has been taken in the Gulf of Lion, in the exploratory European Pilchard (<em>S. pilchardus</em>) fishery, which is characterized by low catch per unit effort (GFCM 2011). Sprat biomass has also been increasing in northern Spain since 2010 (STECF 2015).</span><br/><br/><em>Black Sea</em> - Black Sea sprat stocks collapsed during the 1990s due to a combination of over-fishing and environmental degradation, contributing to a major reorganization of that ecosystem and resulting in a trophic cascade (Daskalov&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). However, sprat abundance was less affected by the introduced ctenophore&#160;<em>Mnemiopsis leydei</em>&#160;than other small pelagics<em>&#160;</em>and recovered relatively well; however, landings from 1998-2002 were only 68% of baseline values established before 1989 (Lembo 1989). Since about 1997, the sprat stock in the Black Sea has been characterized by strong fluctuations in SSB, recruitment, fishing mortality and landings.&#160;Since 2010-2012, SSB and recruitment have been increasing; the SSB in 2016 was estimated at 450,000 tonnes, one of the highest in the time series. These increases in biomass and recruitment were followed by an increase in fishing mortality and landings beginning in 2013. Currently, fishing mortality is below the fishing mortality expected to result in maximum sustainable yield, suggesting that the species is being sustainably exploited in the Black Sea<span style=""""""""> (STECF 2017)</span>.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The life history parameters of this species lend itself to be more sensitive to fishing mortality than the closely-related species, Spiny Dogfish (S. acanthias), which is assessed to be globally Vulnerable. The market for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is expected to increase due to the decline of more traditional groundfish stocks (Fordham 2009), closure of European Union Spiny Dogfish fisheries, and the continuing international demand for shark fins, especially from certified fisheries. The discards and non-target catch data are likely severely underestimated as well (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite all of these pressures, the trend data and stock statuses indicate that this species is not currently under any major threat and none are expected in the near future.<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has historically been landed both commercially and recreationally in most parts of its range. Catches and landings for each stock are listed separately below. For the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, many landings and fishery information are lumped together in most of the literature. The following paragraph is for all North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, and then below, if there is known information for a specific stock, it is described.<br/><br/>There are four major eras of the commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off the west coast of North America, starting with the 1870–1916 time period (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During this fishery, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were primarily exploited for reduction into oil for lubrication, lighting, and fertilizer (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highest volume of oil produced at this time was 1.2 million liters in 1883 (Ketchen 1986). The maximum average weight annually was almost 4,700 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this time period was 4,690 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The second era was from 1917–1939, and during this time North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for reduction into industrial oil and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch during this time was 4,486 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The third era from 1937–1950 was known as the ‘Great Vitamin Liver fishery’ where North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for their livers as a source of vitamin A (Ketchen 1986, Beamish et al. 2009). The landings during this time peaked at 31,000 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). After the discovery of synthetic vitamin A, the fishery collapsed (Ketchen 1986). During 1951–1974, the Canadian government subsidized the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish fishery. It is estimated that 6.7 million fish were taken during this time, all from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). A fishery developed in Washington State in 1975 for human consumption, but the numbers fell through 1981 due to the decline of larger females (Ketchen 1986). In British Columbia, a fishery developed in 1977 for human consumption, with a peak in production in 1979 followed by sharp declines in the 1980s (Ketchen 1986).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>In the U.S., the offshore stock has been commercially fished since 1916 if not before, with two peaks: one in the 1940s (vitamin A liver fishery) and the other in the 1970s (food fishery) (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). During the vitamin A liver fishery, the landings peaked at 16,876 mt, with an average of 6,821 mt per year (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the past decade, the landings have remained lower, ranging from 164 to 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). As of September 2011, the MSC certified the ‘British Columbia North Pacific Spiny Dogfish’ fishery as sustainable (MSC 2011). The MSC is an international non-profit organization that oversees third party objective fishery assessments (MSC 2016a). If the assessment finds that a specific fishery has healthy stocks, minimal ecosystem impacts, and an effective fisheries management system, they certify the fishery as sustainable and label the seafood as such (MSC 2016a). The MSC fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish uses bottom longlines and trawl gear for both the offshore stock and the stock in the Strait of Georgia (MSC 2016b). Around 3,000 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken annually and this catch is lower than the current ‘Total Allowable Catch’ (TAC) for British Columbia (9,250 mt; MSC 2011). In the U.S. today, most of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish commercially landed are from Washington State (accounts for 90% of landings in U.S.) and for the last 10 years, landings have ranged between 164 and 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). This species is commonly caught as bycatch today, with the majority discarded at sea (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). There are three fishing techniques that currently catch dogfish: trawl, hook and line, and a variety of nets (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The recreational catch of this species does not account for a large proportion (1% verses 99% commercial) of total landings, but this statistic does not include any discards, which are believed to be considerable since the general statistic for discards is that 91% of encountered North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are discarded at sea (Bargmann and Zielinski 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>The Puget Sound inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>This stock has experienced two catch peaks in the past 80 years in terms of commercial fishing, and is currently at low levels (Palsson 2009). Before World War II, the catches were below 1,000 mt per year, and beginning in the 1940s, landings increased from less than a few hundred mt per year to over 4,000 mt per year (Palsson 2009). Following that peak, catches declined in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 1,000 mt per year, and almost to zero in the early 1970s (Palsson 2009). The mid-1970s marked the beginning of the second peak, with catches increasing to over 1,500 mt per year in the late 1970s through early 1980s, peaking at 4,000 mt per year in 1979 (Palsson 2009). In the following years (mid-1980s through mid-1990s), the harvest further declined to less than 1,000 mt per year and then to 300 mt per year starting in 1997 (Palsson 2009). These catch data do not include discards (Palsson 2009). Between 1982 and 2000, &gt;70% of the harvest was from the northern part of the Sound, although during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the harvest was more equal between the northern and southern Sound (Palsson 2009). The Washington [State] Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Puget Sound Survey indicated that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance was at a low level, but the estimates from 2001 were higher than 1997 (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>The commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Strait of Georgia dates back to the 1800s, with several peaks and troughs throughout its history. In the first era during 1870–1916, 65% of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exploited were from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the second era from 1917–1939, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were almost exclusively taken from the Strait of Georgia, with an estimation of 143,038 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The annual average catch was 4,486 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the government subsidized fishing era (1951–1974), 6.7 million fish, or 22,872 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from the Strait of Georgia (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Again, from 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish et al. 2009). Since 2006, commercial fisheries for groundfish have 100% observer at-sea monitoring to account for bycatch (Mawani 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this stock are also caught in the certified MSC fishery (see above).<br/><br/><strong><em>Alaskan stock</em></strong>: <br/>There is no directed fishery in Alaska (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011), although this species makes up a large proportion of bycatch in many economically valuable fisheries, namely longline fisheries for sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>), Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) (Conrath and Foy 2009, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Information on the bycatch in Alaska is as follows, and is taken from the pre-STAR report for the Pacific Management Fishery Council meeting 11–15 July 2011 to asses the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, and is from various sources. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken from the Gulf of Alaska in the Pacific Salmon gillnet fisheries, sablefish fisheries, Pacific Halibut longline fisheries, and groundfish trawl fisheries (Boldt 2003 in Gertseva and Taylor 2011). Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that an average of 530 tons per year of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from 1997–2007. Furthermore, the bycatch from State waters is not completely known (but estimates are documented in various reports, e.g. <a href=""""https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf"""">https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf</a>) and the bycatch from Federal waters are considered to be a conservative estimate due to the incomplete observing of fisheries (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The NMFS and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Gulf of Alaska surveys that collectively cover 1984–2003 indicate that there is a stable trend with increasing catch rates in 2003, and overall both indicate that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Gulf of Alaska are stable or even increasing (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>In Japan, this species has historically been landed and used. Beginning in 1990, a fishery developed for the bycatch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from bottom longline fishing vessels targeting Pacific cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) or Pacific halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) in Hokkaido, and Aomori, Akita, and Ishikawa prefectures (northern part of Honshu, and central area of the Japan Sea coast, respectively). The fishery intensity reflected the oscillating price of fishmeal fertilizer (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Hokkaido, a bottom gillnet fishery (with the exception of one prefecture using longline) developed during the same time (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). During WWII, the bottom longline fishery expanded off Hokkaido and then into the sea of Okhotsk after WWII resulting from the increased demand from increased numbers of fish meal and liver oil factories (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Industrial bottom trawling for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish began, but soon shifted to bottom longlining (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). The ‘total shark landing of Japan' was 50,000 mt in 1947 but it soon increased to 120,000 mt in 1950 (Taniuchi 1990 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1951–1955, the average North Pacific Spiny Dogfish catch was over 44,000 mt (Nakano et al. 2009). From 1956–1959 the catch was about 30,000 mt per year, and from 1959–1967, the catch decreased steadily to less than 10,000 mt per year (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately, in 1968, landing statistics for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>), Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), and ‘other’ shark were combined into one category (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Since the 1950s, catches have greatly declined, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) stated that it was probably due to a reduction in stocks, decreased demand, and low prices (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Most recently, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are caught in the offshore bottom trawl fishery, with catches ranging from 1,000 mt (1970s) to less than 500 mt in recent years (Nakano et al. 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish continues to be caught incidentally in local and offshore industrial fisheries (Nakano et al. 2009). Since North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are currently caught in the Aomori prefecture with bottom longlines, the larger females are more vulnerable due to their schooling and demersal nature (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Currently, the majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is caught by the offshore bottom trawl fishery (Kitagawa 2005 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009) and bottom longline fishery (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009), which selectively fishes for the mature members of the population, frequently mature pregnant females. Catch rates in Danish seines and bull trawls fell 90% from 100–200 kg per haul in the mid 1970s to 10–20 kg per haul in the late 1990s (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2003 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the decline in fishing effort in the inshore waters, (specifically the number of tows by the Japanese Danish seine fishery) since 2003, the CPUE (kg/tow) has increased in the same time period (Nakano et al. 2009). In addition, the fishery effort had increased from the early 1970s through 1990, and decreased since (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) concluded that the Japanese population of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish decreased historically and stayed low. In addition, Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported that an assessment report by Kitagawa (2005), that stated that the life history parameters of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish prevented it from restoring to pre-fished levels, and that fishing effort should not be increased.<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>: <br/>In Russian waters, a directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish occurred pre-WWII, in which several mt were exploited annually (multiple authors in Orlov and Tokranov 2009). Currently, there is no directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but they are incidentally caught in the Pacific salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp.) fisheries (Grigorov and Orlov 2013). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are commonly caught near the bottom off the coast of Eastern Russia (around the Sea of Okhotsk), Kuril Islands, Aleutian Islands, and eastern Bering Sea (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).","<p>                  </p><p>Management exists in a very small area of this species’ range (Fordham <em>et al. </em>2006a, 2006b), and it is still taken as non-target catch in many fisheries or discarded at sea (Conrath and Foy 2009). Regulations are in place for British Columbia; North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are included in the integrated fisheries management plan under ‘other species’ with a total allowable catch (TAC) (the TAC has not been restrictive as the catch is lower than the allotment), allocation information, time, area, and gear restrictions, and enforcement requirements for each fishery for the fishing season (Mawani 2009). For the MSC certified fishery, the TAC for British Columbia is 14,000 mt with 9,520 mt accessible to the longline sector and 4,480 mt accessible by the trawl sector (MSC 2011). This fishery has 100% monitoring on-board and at landing sites to record all fishing activities. In Puget Sound, both the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the treaty tribes of Puget Sound manage North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (Palsson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Palsson 2009). The Pacific Fishery Management Council federally regulates this species off of the Pacific Coast of the United States, having included it into the ‘other fish’ category in the groundfish management plan, but catches are not limited (PFMC 2008, Bargmann 2009). In Japan, there are no regulations in place for this species, and in a 2005 assessment, there were recommendations to not increase fishing pressure (Nakano <em>et al.</em> 2009). Regulations for Russian and the Koreas were not found during this assessment. </p>",Decreasing,"The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was previously assessed to be Vulnerable as subpopulations of the Spiny Dogfish (<em>S. acanthias</em>) in the Northeast Pacific and as Endangered in the Northwest Pacific. However, in the majority of the range of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, the population appears to be either stable or increasing. To that end, we have listed the current population trend for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish as stable. This species has had a long history of exploitation and decline, but over the past decade, only small-scale targeted fisheries have existed, and the literature confirms that the majority of the population was found to be stable, if not increasing.<br/><br/>No genetic differences exist among North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in different regions of the Pacific Ocean Basin (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). ‘Stocks’ as used here are not genetically distinct groups but divided based upon movement and exchange of individuals. It is thought that there are at least three stocks off the coast of North America: one offshore stock from Alaska to Baja California, and one each in both the Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1984, Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009, Brodeur <em>et al</em>. 2009, Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further work is needed to clarify the degree of connectivity of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off Alaska to those in Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, and the to the offshore stock (Conrath and Foy 2009, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian waters, Saunders (1989) estimated that one-half to two-thirds constitutes the offshore stock, with the remaining in the inshore stock (Strait of Georgia). No estimate was found for the proportion of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. portion of the offshore stock verses the stock in south Puget Sound, the U.S. portion of the sound. The highest known densities in North America occur off British Columbia and Washington State, with density declining southward (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is thought that the stocks in the Sea of Japan and off the coast of Japan (Pacific Ocean) are separate (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). While transoceanic migrations from the U.S. West Coast to the Pacific Coast of Japan have been documented, the degree of connectivity between the two is not completely known (Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003).<br/><br/>Population trends for each stock are discussed below.<br/><br/><strong><em>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>In U.S. Pacific coastal waters, the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was estimated to be at 53% of the unexploited level, which does not meet the requirements to be considered overfished (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In addition, the historical abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has always been above the management target (defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output), and in the past 10 years, a 1% relative exploitation rate (see Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, the British Columbian portion of the offshore stock is listed in the ’healthy zone’ with a maximum sustainable yield biomass (BMSY) of over 80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). This assessment also reported a biomass estimate of 210,063–318,841 mt, or 63–96% of the initial biomass (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). The long-term trend from the Hecate Strait survey shows that the stock appears to be stable (Wallace et al. 2009). In addition, data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) West Coast triennial survey have not indicated that there has been a change in abundance (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Puget Sound inshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>For geographical clarification, here, Puget Sound proper is considered to be South Puget Sound, with the northern region belonging to the Strait of Georgia (McFarlane and King 2009). The population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Puget Sound was judged to have declined based on groundfish stock assessments from the region (Palsson 2009; PSAT 1998, 2000, 2002), with data from both fishery-dependent and -independent ‘assessment techniques’ (see Palsson 2009). Coincidental declines in the commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) since 1997 were found (Palsson 2009), and the biomass indicators from bottom-trawl surveys show a marked decline from the mid-1990s and forward, corresponding to declines in total harvest and CPUE for set-nets (Palsson 2009). In addition, there was a 64% decline in biomass found from surveys in 1987–1991 and surveys conducted thereafter (Palsson 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>There have been contrasting stock statuses found for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia. In the U.S. portion, an 82% decline in biomass over the past three decades has been found (see Palsson 2009). This is in direct contrast to the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Canadian proportion, which, based upon fishery performance and survey abundance, have remained stable or are actually increasing from the mid-1980s to 2005 (King and McFarlane 2009, Wallace et al. 2009). King and McFarlane (2009) examined the trends in North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the Strait of Georgia from 1980–2005, and concluded that the relative abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has remained stable over the past 20 years. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2009) looked at the CPUE from the southwest region of Vancouver Island and Hecate Strait, and concluded that the outside stock is stable and fishing pressure is low relative to the size of the estimated population. In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, biomass estimated from two different models categorize this stock in the ‘cautious zone’ as the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) is between 40–80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). Palsson (2009) notes that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the northern portion of Puget Sound was higher in 2004–2005 than previous years, which he suggests may be due to recovery or immigrants from the Canadian population. Due to the conflicting views of population trend data in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia, more work is needed to clarify the abundance trend.<br/><br/>A recent Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) report summarized the available survey indices and found that most are moderate or poor in quality with respect to estimating North Pacific Spiny Dogfish trends mainly because they span less than one generation (51 years) (COSEWIC 2011). Consequently the indices are highly variable and uncertain. It was recognized that the mean size of individuals captured has declined over time since the earliest available data were from 1970–1990s (COSEWIC 2011).<br/><br/><em><strong>Alaskan Stock</strong></em>:<br/>Conrath and Foy (2009) examined CPUE from the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands, incidental catch, and abundance from surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (CPUE data collected years 1984–2007), the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) (CPUE collected years 1997–2006), and NMFS’s North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program (CPUE for years 1979–1994 for Japanese-U.S. cooperative longline survey; 1988–2007 for U.S. only longline survey; incidental catch years 1990–2007; abundance in Gulf of Alaska 1984–2007) to determine the abundance, distribution, and status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Alaska. Based upon CPUE abundance indices and incidental catch rates, they found that decadal trends in abundance showed an increase in the central and eastern Gulf of Alaska in recent years (see Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/>In summary, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian Pacific waters are considered to be stable, as three separate surveys have indicated no long-term upward or downward trend (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the U.S., North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance appears stable or increasing off of Alaska, stable for the offshore stock, and at a low level in Puget Sound (but with little fishing pressure) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>Trends for this area are scarce, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009), after reviewing the fisheries, utilisation, and stock status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, stated that assessing the trend for this area would be difficult based upon the data at hand (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). These researchers did project that the population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in this area had declined historically and remained low (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Yet, fishermen are attempting to avoid them as bycatch and directed fishing effort is decreasing (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>:<br/>The status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Northwest Pacific is largely unknown, but the range over the past decade may have expanded due to temperature fluctuations and climate change (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p></p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Sharks referred to as <em>S. blainvillei</em> are fished with bottom trawls, gillnets and line gear in the tropical eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, however the catch is probably multispecies and includes members of the <em>S. megalops</em> and <em>S. mitsukurii </em>groups (including high and low-finned species) (Compagno in prep.). Catch levels are uncertain due to identification problems.<br/><br/>Apparently regularly present in fish markets throughout Adriatic ports, including Sicily, Tunisia, Morocco, Greece, Turkey and occasionally elsewhere (Bauchot 1987), although difficulties with identification may pose a problem.<br/><br/>There is evidence for significant catches of <em>Squalus</em> species in the northeastern Mediterranean, particularly in the northern Tyrrhenian sea (Serena pers. obs. 2006). <em>Squalus </em>species are taken as bycatch of the bottom trawl fishery targeting red shrimps in the Strait of Sicily. About one third of the catch of this fishery is chondrichthyan bycatch, of which <em>S. acanthias</em> and <em>S. blainvillei</em> compose about 5% (Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2000). In this area both dogfish, <em>S. acanthias</em> and <em>S. blainvillei</em>, are captured in significant numbers due to the good quality of their meat, which is marketed for human consumption (1,200 tons of <em>Squalus</em> species were landed in 1982) (Cingolani <em>et al</em>. 1986).<br/><br/>In the Black Sea <em>S. acanthias</em> and <em>S. blainvillei</em> are taken as bycatch by purse seines targeting pelagic fishes like anchovy, sardines and horse mackerel. The abundance of dogfish in these catches has displayed similar fluctuations to the targeted species. Dogfish catch has gradually decreased and reached  645 metric tons for Turkish area and 430 metric tons for the Black Sea. According to Serena <em>et al</em>. (2005) catch data indicate that the Black Sea and eastern Black Sea catches have decreased to 67% and 62%, respectively (Turkish State Statistics Institute 2004 In: Basusta <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Directed fisheries for <em>S. acanthias</em> undertaken during the 1970s in areas of the northwestern Mediterranean (off the Balearic Islands) have ceased as a result of declines in the stock of <em>S. acanthias</em> (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2006). <em>Squalus blainvellei</em> is of limited fisheries importance compared to <em>S. acanthias</em>, but may also have been impacted by fishing pressure in this area.",None in place. Critical taxonomic revision of this species complex is required in the first instance to accurately define the distribution and make a full assessment of the population of this species.,Unknown,"Taxonomic confusion with several other species prevents accurate determination of population trends.<br/><br/>Data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey program (MEDITS) (scientific trawl surveys undertaken since 1994 along the European Mediterranean coasts at depths of 10-800 m, 10,000 hauls) were analysed by Serena <em>et al</em>. (2005). <em>Squalus blainvillei </em>composed 3% of the total catch of elasmobranchs during this survey (1,500 tons out of a total 55,000 tons). This species appears less abundant than <em>Squalus acanthias</em> which composed 6,700 tons of the total catch. No more than 10% of the individuals of these species sampled weighed more than 2 kg.<br/><br/>It was no possible to determine the trend in abundance of this species in the Mediterranean Sea because the data are highly uncertain (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_unknown_status

At the beginning of the 2000s, another fishery developed in the area for the anglerfish&#160;<em>Lophius gastrophysis</em> with bottom gillnets at depths of 130 to 600 m, and this species was caught as bycatch (Perez and Wahrlich 2005, Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). Since 2004, both of these fisheries have been closed, but angel sharks are still captured illegally by trawl and gillnet fisheries and landed without skins in clandestine ports (Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>The nocturnal habits of angel sharks render them susceptible to bottom gillnets which are set at night, and increases in captures during the 1990s are attributed to the introduction of this gear on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil at that time. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>Part of this species' southern distribution in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone overlaps with the Patagonian scallop (<em>Zygochlamis patagonica</em>) bottom trawl fishery, which is likely to catch this species as bycatch.","<p>In Brazil, trawling in inshore waters is prohibited and all angel sharks are protected, but enforcement of this regulation has been and still is not sufficient (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017). The conservation status of this species will rely heavily upon the successful implementation of these management arrangements. Full observer coverage onboard domestic vessels should provide accurate monitoring of trends in the future. Molecular markers of <em>Squatina</em> spp. have been determined for future  identification of these species in local markets (Falcão <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected area will be increased from 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore. <br/><br/>The Argentine Angelshark is classified as Critically Endangered (A2bd+4bd) in Brazil (ICMBio 2016). The Angular and Hidden Angelsharks are also both classified as Critically Endangered there, and all three of these species are fully protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the normative instructions numbers 5 and 445.&#160; <br/><br/>The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans in the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated by the Binational Technical Comision (<em>Comisión Técnica Mixta del Frente Marítimo</em>). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, the angel sharks <em>Squatina </em>spp. and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between 2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay. <br/><br/>There is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in the Argentine Sea and is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone between 36° and 37°S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km² is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between years and it is applied to all type of vessels using bottom net trawling.<br/><br/>Nursery areas of the species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no take protection in the country. At the same time an assessment of the relative composition of each species in commercial landings in each country is needed.<br/><br/>The species was assessed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to determine whether its status warranted listing under the US Endangered Species Act (Casselberry and Carlson 2015). The species was listed as Endangered as a result in 2017. <br/><br/>Research and monitoring of population size and landings are needed across this species’ range.</p>",Decreasing,"Angel shark identification in the Southwest Atlantic is difficult, and therefore catches are typically reported for the genus rather than at the species level. There are three species with overlapping ranges, depths, and habitat types in the region (Angular Angelshark, Argentine Angelshark, and Hidden Angelshark), and all are likely to face similar threats and fishing pressure.<strong><br/><br/>Southern Brazil</strong><br/>Angel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and significant reductions have been documented there. In the mid-1980s, the Argentine Angelshark was common and abundant in scientific  research trawls on the outer shelf and upper slope of Rio Grande do  Sul (Vooren and Klippel 2005). During this period, commercial fishing in the area had not yet begun, and a  resident population of this species with high natural abundance existed. Annual catches of angel shark (<em>Squatina </em>spp.) peaked at about 2,000 t in 1986-1989 and again in 1993, and then decreased to 900 t in 2003 (equivalent to a reduction of 93% over three generations). Angel shark CPUE by otter trawl and pair trawl during research cruises on the continental shelf decreased by about 85% from 1984 to 2002 (CEPERG 2003, Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).               <br/><br/>An angel shark bottom gillnet fishery commenced around 1990 and angel sharks used to be caught in the 2000s in large amounts by this gear (Miranda and Vooren 2003). Detailed analysis of two independent sets of scientific fishing data at  depths of 100-500 m constitutes evidence that between 1986 and 2002 the  abundance of both<em> </em>Hidden and Argentine Angelsharks experienced a reduction of around 80% on the shelf and upper slope in the area between Cabo de Santa Marta Grande (28°40’S) and Arroio Chuí (33°50’S), which is equivalent to a reduction of &gt;98% over three generations.  Data on scientific fishing and commercial fishing together are evidence  that between 1986 and 2002 there was a reduction of about 80% for angel sharks on the southern Brazilian slope (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Another dataset indicates that there was an 86% reduction in Argentine Angelshark between 1986 and 2001 (R. Barreto unpubl. data 2018).<br/><br/>Research trawl surveys of the outer shelf in the years 1986/87 and 2001/02 confirmed that in southern Brazil the abundance of Angular Angelshark has decreased to 15% of its original level and this is attributed to recruitment overfishing primarily due to the bottom gillnet fishery (Vooren and Klippel 2005). <br/><br/><strong>Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ)<br/></strong>The Argentine Angelshark is uncommon in Uruguay and Argentina in  commercial landings but is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Uruguay, angel sharks are caught by trawling on the platform and declared as “angelito”. Annual catches of Angular, Argentine, and Hidden Angelsharks together in Uruguay were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between 1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the average declared landings of angel sharks was 277 t and decreased to less than 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is no clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM 2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi <em>et al. </em>(2001) found that Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch.<br/><br/>Argentinian landings in the AUCFZ declined by 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent to a 78% reduction over three generation lengths (CTMFM 2018).<strong><br/><br/><br/>Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)</strong><br/>In Argentina, the three species of the genus are landed together as “pez ángel” and it is probable that more than 90% of the landed angel sharks are Angular Angelshark (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2018). The declared landings of all angel sharks in Argentina decreased by 45% from 2007-2016 with a total of 39509.7 MT and an average of 3950.8 MT (J.-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018), which is equivalent to a reduction of 95% over three generations. Again, it is stressed that these landings trends are probably not appropriate to assign to this species, as most of the landed angel sharks have been Angular Angelshark.<p>Overall, given documented declines in landings and research trawls, the presence of heavy fishing pressure across its range, and its relatively low productivity, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years). <br/></p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

The species was also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line and spearfishing techniques and this may have been a significant source of mortality in Irish waters (Quigley 2006), and may still be a source of mortality in the Canary Islands (Barker <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; <br/><br/>Degradation of important Angelshark habitat through unsustainable coastal development and coastal infrastructure is of concern, especially in nursery areas identified in shallow inshore waters (Barker <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Reports of Angelshark from Turkish waters have increased since the mid-1990s and into the 2010s (Ögretmen <em>et al.</em> 2005, Karakulak <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ismen <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bulguroglu <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ciçek <em>et al.</em> 2014, Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2014, Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2015, Yaglioglu <em>et al.</em> 2015, MEDLEM database), although numbers are still very low and this apparent increase could be due to more attention being paid to reporting angel shark catches.</a><br/><br/>Data from scientific trawl surveys in the Mediterranean (mainly the  Mediterranean International Trawl Survey—MEDITS—and the Italian  National Project (National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation—GRUND)) are in agreement with what is stated above. Catch data series  from 1985 show a very low density of Angelshark in the northern Mediterranean - only two individuals were captured in 6,336 hauls between 1994 and 1999 (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>The ICES Working Group on Elasmobranch Fisheries (WGEF) considered that “comparisons  of historical data with the near-absence in recent data (landings,  surveys, observer programs, angling data)  are sufficient to consider the species to be severely depleted in the  Celtic Seas ecoregion and possibly extirpated from the North Sea  ecoregion” (ICES 2016), supporting the view it is locally extinct in the latter area. ICES WGEF also noted that “Whilst  its status in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coastal waters is unknown,  it is considered very rare, with only occasional individuals reported”.<br/><br/>In the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, Vacchi <em>et al.</em> (2002) and Ferretti <em>et al.</em> (2005) reported the steep decline (&gt;90%) of angel sharks (all three species in the region), beginning as early as between 1898 and 1922.&#160;<span class=""""MsoCommentReference"""">Trawl surveys in that area between 1972 and 2004 did not find any species of angel shark, suggesting declines of the genus until extirpation (Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2005). In the Adriatic Sea, Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2013) found a similar pattern, where the last report of Angelshark from five different scientific trawl surveys covering the period 1948-2005 dated back to 1958. Similarly, Fortibuoni <em>et al</em>. (2016) reviewed the historical occurrence of Angelshark in the Northern Adriatic, reporting declines &gt;90% and showing the collapse of the species in the early 1970s, even though they reported its current presence there. Maynou <em>et al</em>. (2011) stated that Angelsharks are likely to have disappeared in the Catalan Sea by 1959. In western Italy, Angelsharks would have disappeared by the early 1980s near the mainland and the mid-1980s in Sardinia. Declines have also been reported from studies off the Balearic Islands where this species, previously relatively frequent, may now be absent. Massutí and Moranta (2003) reported no captures of any species of&#160; angel shark&#160;from four bottom trawl fishing surveys (131 hauls, at a depth range of 46 to 1,800 m) carried out between 1996 and 2001 around the Balearic Islands.<br/><br/>Based on these historical declines inferred through changes in CPUE, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that the Angelshark population size has been reduced by at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) over the past three generations (~45 years).</span></p>",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th

Sedberry pers. comm. 2014). Commercial landings of <em>S.&#160;chrysops</em>&#160;in the Middle Atlantic&#160;Bight have declined substantially since peak landings in&#160;the 1950s and early 1960s, although, there was a minor&#160;peak in landings in the early 1980s (Northeast&#160;Fisheries Science Center 1997). Recreational landings&#160;have also declined (Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council 1996, Steimle <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Based on a 2012 stock assessment, <em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;is not overfished and overfishing&#160;was not occurring in 2011 as fishing mortality was estimated below the fishing mortality threshold reference point (Terceiro 2012). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) of this species decreased from about 100,000 mt in 1963 to about 50,000 mt in 1969 and subsequently increased to about 75,000 mt in the 1970s. SSB declined through the 1980s and 1990s to less than 5,000 mt but by 2004 SSB had increased to over 100,000 mt due to improved recruitment and reduced fishing mortality (Terceiro 2012).

In more recent years, commercial landings averaged about 6,000 mt from 2010 to 2012 with reported 2012 landings in the commercial fishery at 7,122 mt, which is about 56% if the commercial quota. From 1979 to 2012, about 80% of the commercial landings were in Rhodes Island (38%), New Jersey (24%), and New York (18%). The primary gear used to fish&#160;<em>S. chrysops&#160;</em>is the otter trawl and comprised about 76% of the total catch since 1979 with the rest of the catch taken by floating trap (10%); hand lines (6%); and paired trawl, pound nets, and pots and traps comprising about 1% to 3% (Linton and Terceiro 2013).&#160;<em>Stenotomus chrysops&#160;</em>is also a major component in the recreational fishery with the greatest proportion of catches taken in Massachusetts, Rhodes Island, Connecticut, and New York. Estimated recreational landings (excluding estimates of fish that were caught and released) from 1981 to 2011 averaged about 2,000 mt per year and recreational landings for the rod-and-reel fishery from 2012 were 1,842 mt, comprising about 48% of the recreational harvest limits. Recreational landings have averaged 32% since 1981 of the commercial and recreational landings total. Total commercial and recreational landings for 2012 were 8,964 mt with total commercial and recreational discards for 2012 at 11,477 mt.

From 1977 to 1985, an average of 24% (ranging from 17% to 33%) of the harvest of&#160;&#160;<em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;along the East Coast was taken by anglers (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries accessed 2009).<br/><br/>Commercial discards have been estimated to average 35% to 40% of the total commercial catch since the implementation of the Gear Restricted Areas in 2000. From 1963 to 2003, recreational live release and discard mortality estimates increased by 11%. Recreational live discards in weight from 1984 to 2011 range from 39 mt in 1999 to 2,031 mt in 2010, averaging about 600 mt per year, and about 1,542 mt in 2012.

Bycatch of eulachon in commercial offshore groundfish and shrimp trawl fisheries may be substantial; shrimp trawling, especially, has increased in the last decade (Hay and McCarter 2000). <br/><br/>Threats to eulachon habitat include diversions/dams, logging, dredging and industrial pollution of streams and rivers, all of which may affect water volume, temperature and sediment levels in spawning habitat. Native communities in Southeast Alaska have noted declining eulachon harvests and expressed concern about the effects of log rafting and pollution on fish habitat (Drake and Wilson 1991). <br/><br/>Recent changes in ocean climate, including increased surface water temperatures, have been recognized in the Gulf of Alaska and elsewhere in the species range, and have resulted in a general reorganization of fish communities in some areas (Anderson and Piatt 1999, Hay and McCarter 2000). High water temperatures can be lethal to cold-water acclimated fish.  A study of 5°C-acclimated eulachon immersed in 11°C water for several days resulted in 50% mortality and spawning failure (Blahm and McConnell 1971 in Willson et al. 2003).","Conservation needs: continued protection of spawning habitat through restricted dredging and management of logging and industrial water pollution; limitation of bycatch in commercial shrimp fisheries by conducting catch-monitoring assessments and mandating area closures when bycatch limits are reached; require use of fishery observers and selectivity devices which allow passive exit of bycatch species through escape panels (i.e., the Nordmore grid).<br/><br/>In British Columbia, shrimp trawl fisheries are required to use bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) and to close shrimp fishing when bycatch limits of eulachon and other non-target species are reached, even if shrimp catch is below the allowable quota (Hay and McCarter 2000). In the U.S., the Magnuson-Stevens Act requires NMFS to reduce non-targeted bycatch in commercial fisheries, but currently there are few BRD requirements to shrimp fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.",Unknown,"This species is represented by a large number of subpopulations and locations.<br/><br/>In Alaska, this species is seasonally abundant from Southeast to Cook Inlet (Hay et al. 1997); abundance decreases from east to west toward the Aleutian Islands (Bartlett 1994). Relative abundance in the Bering Sea is highest between Unimak Island/end of the Alaska Peninsula and the Pribilof Islands (Anderson, in Willson et al. 2003). Eulachon is reported as widespread in trawl samples in the coastal fjords of northern southeast Alaska (Willson et al. 2003). Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Gulf of Alaska varied almost cyclically between 1972 and 1997 from ~0.3 kg/km to ~1.9 kg/km (Anderson and Piatt 1999). However, catch data are not necessarily considered a reliable measure of population abundance or even presence/absence (NMFS 1999), nor are they available for species' entire range in the state.<br/><br/>Highly variable or possibly cyclical run size makes trends in abundance hard to interpret (NMFS 1999). Nearly all runs in the southern part of their range (California to BC) have declined during the last 20 years (Hay and McCarter 2000). Commercial catches on the Fraser River have declined since the 1940s and 1950s (Hay et al. 1997). In 1994, sudden drastic declines were recorded in three large southern rivers, the Fraser, Columbia, and Klinaklini, resulting in the closure of major commercial fisheries on the Fraser and Columbia Rivers in the late 1990s (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003). Due to continued low abundance, NMFS was petitioned to list the Columbia River populations as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1999. Eulachon runs diminished over the last two decades in the Kitimat River, BC, and became chemically tainted as a result of industry and urbanization (Hay et al. 1997, Hay and McCarter 2000).<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years or three generations is uncertain but likely relatively stable or slowly declining.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

In the Eastern Pacific it is also a bycatch of swordfish fisheries. Albacore Tuna are caught by long-line gear in most of the North and South Pacific (but not often between about 10°N and 5°S), by trolling gear in the eastern and central North and South Pacific, and by pole-and-line gear in the western North Pacific. In the North Pacific about 60% of the fish are taken in pole-and-line and troll fisheries that catch smaller, younger Albacore Tuna, whereas about 90% of the albacore caught in the South Pacific are taken by long-line (IATTC 2008).<br/><br/>Catches of northern Atlantic Albacore Tuna are primarily made by pole-and-line (35%), trolling (28%), trawlers (17%) and longline (17%). The main fisheries are Spain, France, and Chinese Taipei. Surface fisheries concentrate mainly in the Bay of Biscay and the Azores and Canary Islands during summer and fall, taking young fish while longline vessels operate throughout the Atlantic year-round and target larger fish (ISSF 2010). For the south Atlantic stock, the main fisheries are longliners from Chinese Taipei (56%), pole-and-line from South Africa (18%) and from Namibia (13%). Surface fisheries operate mainly between October and May capturing juvenile and subadult fish (ISSF 2010).","This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department, 1994).<br/><br/>In the north Atlantic, a total allowable catch (TAC) of 28,000 tonnes was established for 2010  and 2011 for the northern stock. TACs are also in place for the southern  Atlantic albacore fishery. For the south Atlantic, the TAC for  2009–2011 is 29,900 and adjustments are made to reduce the TACs in the  following year if the actual catch exceeds the TAC in a given year  (ICCAT 2009). The driftnet fishery for albacore has been banned since January 1<sup>st</sup>   2002 in the European Union countries and from 2004 in all the ICCAT Mediterranean   countries, but it is known that illegal fishing activity still occurs  in  some areas (STEFC 2007).<br/><br/>In the North Pacific, the International Scientific Committee-Albacore  Working Group strongly recommends that all countries support  precautionary-based fishing practices (e.g., limits on current levels of  fishing effort) given the current level of fishing  mortality (ISC 2008). In the Indian Ocean, there are no conservation measures in place, but a new assessment for this species is recommended by 2010.",Decreasing,"FAO worldwide reported landings show a steady increase from 103,676 t in 1950 to 284,542 t in 2006 (FAO 2009). There are six stocks that are globally managed for this species. As of 2004, the stock in the North Atlantic is considered Overexploited; the Indian Ocean and North Pacific are Fully Exploited; the South Atlantic and South Pacific are Moderately Exploited; and the Mediterranean is Unknown (Majkowski 2007). Populations in the Eastern Pacific consist of the South Pacific stock and the North Pacific stock. Details of the migration remain unclear, but juvenile fish (2–5 years) are believed to move into the eastern Pacific Ocean in the spring and early summer, and return to the western and central Pacific, perhaps annually, in the late fall and winter, where they tend to remain as they mature (IATTC 2008). Recent estimates of total catch data from IATTC (2008) for the Eastern Pacific are 24,604 mt (2005), 30,393 mt (2006), and 8,587 mt (2007).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">North Pacific Ocean</span><br/>An assessment for the North Pacific stock conducted in 2006 (Stocker 2006, ISC 2008) found that spawning stock biomass (SSB) has experienced slight fluctuations since 1960s, but has remained relatively stable at ~90,000 mt over the last two decades. Linear regression of SSB over the past 20 years (1987–2005), shows only a very small decline of approximately 6%. The total catch increased substantially in 2007, to a level typical of the catches occurring during the 1996–2004 period, while preliminary catch for 2008 decreased to a level more consistent with catches after 2004. Even though current fishing mortality is projected to be above FMSY, recent changes in the distribution of the fishery need to be appropriately standardized before relative abundance can be accurately reflected (Holmes 2009).

However, the conclusion is that this species is not in an overfished state, with current catch levels being sustainable (Hoyle and Davies 2009). Although estimates are highly variable between model configurations, 2004–2006 mortality is estimated to be below FMSY, and 2004–2006 biomass is estimated to be above BMSY, and spawning stock biomass between 2004–2006 is estimated to be above SSBMSY (Hoyle and Davies 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Indian Ocean</span><br/>The only stock assessment available for this species in the Indian Ocean, conducted in 2008, may be unreliable (Hilary 2008). In terms of predicted stock-status, the model predicted that the stock biomass in the Indian Ocean was very close to MSY but that the current harvest rate was above the MSY level indicating that over-fishing may be occurring. The 2007 catch level (31,226 tonnes) was predicted to be above the MSY level (27,022 tonnes) with high probability. This assessment is very preliminary and it should be recommended that a more realistic fully age/length structured model be developed for the future to assess this stock (Hilary 2008).<br/><br/>Based on this exploratory stock assessment, estimated SSB in the Indian Ocean has declined approximately 55% over the past 20 years (1987–2007), even though in the past four years (2002–2006) estimated SSB has increased from 20,000 to 40,000 tonnes. Standardized CPUE has also declined over the past 25 years, but has been relatively stable since 1990 (IOTC 2008). Current mortality is below FMSY. Although results of these analyses are considered preliminary and indicative only, it was concluded that this stock is not presently overfished (IOTC 2008).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">North Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>Catches of this species in the north Atlantic peaked at 65,000 tonnes in the mid-1960s, then declined to a low of 20,000 tonnes in 2008. This decline is partly due to reduced fishing effort by some surface and longline fisheries. The most recent stock assessment in 2009 indicated that recruitment in the fishery is highly variable, and that biomass since 1993 has been less than biomass at MSY. Currently, the stock is about 40% below the MSY level and spawning stock biomass is currently only 25% of the original biomass (ICCAT 2009). The MSY from the last stock assessment was estimated at 29,000 tonnes, and catches in four of the last ten years have exceeded this value. This species stock in the North Atlantic was recently considered to be in an overfished state (ISSF 2010, Joseph 2009). However, in 2009 catch quotas were adopted in line with scientific  advice to end overfishing.<br/><br/>In the 2009 stock assessment for the north Atlantic (ICCAT 2009), several models were used to evaluated the status of the stock. Based on linear regression of the Multifan base case, estimated spawning stock biomass has decreased approximately 33% over the past 20 years (1987–2007). <br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">South Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>In the South Atlantic, catches have varied from a high of 41,000 tonnes in 1987 to a low of 15,000 tonnes in 1984.

The current estimate of MSY is 33,000 tonnes, ranging between 29,000 and 36,700 tonnes. In the last ten years only one year had a catch exceeding the MSY estimate. It is likely that the stock is below the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level as it was estimated to about 90% of BMSY in 2005, while the 2005 fishing mortality rate was about 60% of FMSY (SCRS ICCAT 2010). The stock is considered to be in a slightly overfished state, but is not currently being fished above MSY (ISSF 2010).<br/><br/>In the 2007 stock assessment for the South Atlantic (ICCAT 2007), several models were used to evaluated the status of the stock.

The Mediterranean albacore fisheries are characterized by high spatio-temporal variability in landings and fishing patterns. Albacore fishing is a traditional activity for a number of fleets including those of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Malta. ICCAT statistics, however, are considered quite incomplete due to unreported catches from several countries and the lack of data in some years from other countries. Fishing effort is not possible to estimate due to short time series and inadequate coverage of artisanal gears. Even though catches of Mediterranean albacore have been increasing for the past few years, there is a lack of general information on this stock and biological information is also limited (ICCAT 2010). Although many countries are not yet reporting any catch for this species, the Mediterranean stock does not show any general trend, and the mixing rate with the Atlantic stock appears to be insignificant (STECF 2007).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

In the Western and Central Pacific purse seiners harvest about 50%, while longline and pole-and-line fleets comprise 15% and 3% respectively.<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, over 40% of purse seine Yellowfin Tuna catches are taken in log-schools along with Skipjack Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. One of the driving forces behind recent changes in the purse seine fishery has been the impact of piracy in the western Indian Ocean, which has led to a decrease of the nominal effort (number of boats, total carrying capacity, number of fishing and searching days, total number of sets) as well as changes in the fishing behaviour due to the new security measures in place (boats working in pairs with military personnel on board, restriction on fishing areas, etc.) (IOTC 2010).<br/><br/>Fisheries exist for this species in the eastern Atlantic between Portugal and South Africa, and in the western Atlantic between the Gulf of Mexico and southern Brazil; longline fisheries occur throughout the entire tropical and temperate Atlantic. The main gears used to catch Yellowfin Tuna in the Atlantic are: purse seines (58%), longline (22%), and pole-and-line (13%) (ISSF 2010). The purse seine fishery is the major contributor to total catches of this species. Landings from baitboats and purse seiners generally declined between 2001–2007 (STECF 2009). The nominal effort in the purse seine fishery had been declining through 2006. As an indicator, the number of purse seiners from the European and associated fleet operating in the Atlantic had declined from 44 vessels in 2001 to 24 vessels in 2006 (last year’s data included during the assessment), with an average vessel age of about 25 years. Since then, however, the number of purse seiners has increased by 50% to 36, as vessels have moved from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. At the same time, the efficiencies of these fleets have been increasing, particularly as the vessels which had been operating in the Indian Ocean tend to be newer and with greater fishing power (ICCAT 2009).","This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>Conservation measures imposed in 2004 for the Eastern Pacific under resolution C-04-09 (IATTC 2008) are predicted to maintain the stock at about the Average Maximum Sustainable Yield level, slightly higher than would otherwise be the case. Three month closures have been proposed by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and Mexico, which has one of the largest fisheries for this species.<br/><br/>In the Western Pacific, there was a two month closure of the FAD fishery in 2009, and three months in 2010 with an objective of achieving a 30% reduction of fishing effort.<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission's (IOTC) Working Party on Tropical Tunas (WPTT) recommends that catches of Yellowfin Tuna in the Indian Ocean should not increase beyond 300,000 t in order to bring the stock to biomass levels that could sustain catches at the MSY level in the long term. If recruitment continues to be lower than average, catches below MSY would be needed to maintain stock levels (IOTC 2010).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT-SCRS) recommended that increased harvest of Yellowfin Tuna could have negative consequences for Bigeye Tuna in particular, and other species caught together with Yellowfin Tuna in fishing operations taking more than one species. The same group also continues to recommend that effective measures be found to reduce fishing mortality of small Yellowfin Tuna to increase long-term sustainable yield. ICCAT-SCRS noted that catch levels in recent years have been held in check, despite increasing efficiencies of individual vessels, by a continued decline in the number of purse seine vessels in the eastern Atlantic. The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) agrees that a continuation of the recent movement of additional newer vessels from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic, with a corresponding increase in fishing mortality should be monitored closely to avoid adverse impacts on stock status (STECF 2009).<br/><br/>ICCAT recommendation 04-01 implemented a small closure for the surface fishing in the area 0–5ºN, 10–20ºE during November in the Gulf of Guinea for purse-seine and pole-and-line vessels. Although this regulation is intended to reduce small Bigeye Tuna catches, the Committee recognizes that its implementation and the change from the previous moratorium to the current regulation will potentially impact Yellowfin Tuna catches. Given the relatively small time-area coverage of the closure, any reduction in juvenile mortality is expected to be minimal (ICCAT 2009).",Decreasing,"FAO reported worldwide landings show a gradual, but variable increase from 110,879 tonnes in 1950, to 1,130,605 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009). Landings data have exponentially increased over the last 50 years (400%). There are four stocks that are globally managed for this species. As of 2004, the stocks in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and Eastern Pacific are considered Fully Exploited, and the Western and Central Pacific stock is considered Fully to Over-exploited (Majkowski 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>Yearly catch levels have declined in the Atlantic Ocean since the peak catch of 194,000 tonnes in 1990. A steady decline occurred between 2001–2007, followed by an increase in 2008. These trends in part reflect changes in the number of purse seiners operating in the Atlantic Ocean (ISSF 2010). Recent trends have differed between the western and eastern Atlantic, with the overall catches in the west declining by 26% since 2006. In the eastern Atlantic, on the other hand, catches have increased by 23% since 2006, mainly due to substantial increases in purse seine effort (SCRS ICCAT 2010).<br/><br/>The most recent stock assessment for Yellowfin Tuna in the Atlantic was conducted in 2008 (ICCAT 2009), which showed that biomass is currently somewhat less than BMSY, but fishing mortality is also less than FMSY (ISSF 2010, ICCAT 2009). Based on linear regression of the middle values of Model 5 and Model 10 in the latest stock assessment (ICCAT 2009), spawning stock biomass (SSB) has declined approximately 22% over the past 10 years (1998–2007). These models suggest that only catches of 130,000 tonnes or less are sustainable.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Eastern Pacific Ocean</span><br/>From 1976–2005 the total catch fluctuated from 100,000 to 443,000 t per year (IATTC 2008). The average annual retained catch of Yellowfin Tuna in the Eastern Pacific during 1991–2005 was 276,000 t, with a peak in 2002 of 443,000 t, the greatest on record. However catch decreased substantially in 2005 to 288,019 t, and in 2006 to 174,780 t (the lowest since 1984).&#160; Current maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is estimated to be about 273,000 t (IATTC 2009, ISSF 2010). Additionally, the average weights of the Yellowfin Tuna caught in 2006 were significantly lower than those of the previous five years (STECF 2007).<br/><br/>The most likely causes of the lesser catches are declines in recruitment, effort in the dolphin-associated fisheries, and catchability (IATTC 2008). The recruitment of Yellowfin Tuna to the fisheries in the Eastern Pacific varies seasonally and in response to regime shifts in productivity. The most recent stock assessment analysis and previous analyses have indicated that the Yellowfin Tuna population has experienced two, or possibly three, different recruitment productivity regimes (1975–1982, 1983–2002, and 2003–2008). The productivity regimes correspond to regimes in biomass, e.g., higher-productivity regimes producing greater biomass levels. Average annual catch of Yellowfin Tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean was 233,000 t&#160; (100,000 to 301,000) during the period from 1975–2001. Variations in part reflect changes in fishing effort and regime shifts in productivity over up to three levels of recruitment. Changes in measures of fishing effort include changes in the proportion of purse seine catch by set type, as well as changes in the overall level of fishing effort, which occur in part in compliance with management action (M.Hinton pers comm 2011).<br/><br/>According to the most recent stock assessment in the Eastern Pacific conducted in 2009 (Maunder and Aires-da-Silva 2010), if the fishing mortality is proportional to the fishing effort and the current patterns of age-specific selectivity are maintained, the current (average of 2006–2008) level of fishing is below FMSY. The spawning stock biomass is also estimated to be above SSBMSY. Based on linear regression of the spawning stock biomass ratio (SBR) reported in the most recent stock assessment (Maunder and Aires-da-Silva 2010), there has been an estimated 49% decline in SBR over the past 10 years (1998–2007).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Indian Ocean</span><br/>The catches of Yellowfin Tuna show a strong seasonality with high catches during the northern winter months and usually low catches from May–June to September–October. The Yellowfin Tuna stock assessment work in the Indian Ocean is an extremely difficult task because of the conflicting trends in the basic data, total yearly catches and abundance indices used based on the longline catch per unit effort (CPUE): the observed trends in Yellowfin Tuna catches and CPUEs are not consistent with production-model dynamics, or really with any known theory of fishing (IOTC 2009).<br/><br/>However, a stock assessment conducted in 2008 (Nishida 2008) indicated that recent levels of fishing mortality are at an historical high level and the stock has experienced a period of overfishing at least during 2003–2006 (e.g., Fcurrent &gt; FMSY).&#160; Biomass based reference points also varied with the assumed level of steepness. For the lowest value of steepness (0.60), spawning biomass in 2007 was estimated to be below the MSY level (SB/SBMSY &lt;1); i.e., the stock is in an overfished state. For higher values of steepness, biomass in 2007 was above the MSY level (SBcurrent &gt; SBMSY) and the stock is not in an overfished state. The model estimated that recent recruitment has been lower than average, and on this basis total and spawning biomass could be expected to decline further over the next few years (IOTC 2008, IOTC 2009).<br/><br/>A size-based, age- and spatially-structured population model (Multifan-CL, MFCL) for the Yellowfin Tuna in the Indian Ocean initially carried out in 2008 was updated in 2009. Based on linear regression of estimated adult biomass (IOTC 2009), estimated SSB has declined approximately 45% over the past 10 years (1999–2008). Depending on the shape of the stock-recruitment relationship, current catches are likely to be higher than the estimated MSY, which ranges from 250,000 to 300,000 t. For example, total annual catches averaged 434,800 t over the period 2003 to 2007 (IOTC 2008), and 372,200 t over the period 2005 to 2009 (IOTC 2010).&#160; However, more recently catches in the Indian Ocean have declined substantially (in 2009 and possibly also in 2010) partly due to Somali-based piracy in the region.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Western and Central Pacific Ocean</span><br/>Since 2000, the total Yellowfin Tuna catch in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) has varied between 370,000 and 440,000 mt.

Longline catches in recent years (70,000–80,000 mt) are well below catches in the late 1970s to early 1980s (which peaked at about 110,000 mt), presumably related to changes in targeting practices by some of the larger fleets (Langley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2009).<br/><br/>Estimated current biomass exceeds the biomass MSY, and current fishing mortality is below FMSY, indicating that the Yellowfin Tuna stock in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is not in an overfished state.

Canning was the most important form of local utilization of this highly esteemed fish until the early 1980s. This species is considered depleted by Majkowski (2007), and seriously overfished by Joseph (2009). If the current exploitation continues, it is estimated that the population will be below 500 mature individuals in 100 years. According the most recent stock assessment, there is no current sign that the spawning stock of this species is rebuilding (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010).","This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. Current worldwide catch quota has been reduced to 9,448 tonnes per year (CCSBT 2009). However, the current fishing capacity is much higher than the quota. There are several management measures in place including catch control, vessel monitoring, etc. However, more restrictions may be needed.<br/><br/>The CCSBT agreed that the status of the stock is at a critical stage and that a meaningful reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) is necessary in order to recover the stock and work toward reaching an interim rebuilding target reference point of 20% of the original spawning stock. Consequently, the CCSBT reduced the global total allowable catch (TAC) for 2010 and 2011 to an average level over the two years of 80% of the previously allocated global TAC of 11,810 tonnes. Accordingly, the average global TAC for each of the 2010 and 2011 fishing seasons will be 9,449 tonnes. <br/><br/>The CCSBT has adopted a number of conservation measures including requirements for fleets to monitor and submit data to show compliance with TACs, development of scientific observer programs, monitoring of farming operations and port inspection of catches.

In addition, this species may undergo further declines if the mortality of the species in bycatch of the Skipjack Tuna fishery cannot be reduced.<br/><br/>In the Pacific, Bigeye Tuna are primarily exploited by longliners from 40°N to 40°S and by purse seiners from 10°N to 20°S. In the Eastern Pacific Ocean there have been substantial changes in the Bigeye Tuna fishery over the last 15 years. Initially, the majority of the Bigeye Tuna catch was taken by longline vessels, but with the expansion of the fishery using fish-aggregating devices (FADs) since 1993, the purse seine fishery has taken an increasing proportion of the Bigeye Tuna catch. The FAD fishery captures smaller Bigeye Tuna, and has therefore reduced the yield per recruit and the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). On average, the fishing mortality of Bigeye Tuna less than four and a half years old has increased substantially since 1993, and that of older fish has increased slightly (IATTC 2008).<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, Bigeye Tuna is mainly caught by industrial purse seine and longline fisheries and appears only occasionally in the catches of other fisheries. However, in recent years the amounts of Bigeye Tuna caught by gillnet fisheries are likely to be considerably higher due to the major changes experienced in some of these fleets, notably changes in boat size, fishing techniques and fishing grounds. In recent years catches of Bigeye Tuna in the western Indian Ocean have dropped considerably, especially in areas off Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania and in particular in 2008 and, especially, 2009. The drop in catches is the consequence of a drop in fishing effort in the area of both purse seine and longline fisheries, due to the effect of piracy in the western Indian Ocean region, while catches are increasing in the eastern Indian Ocean probably due to the shift of some longline fleet in the areas because of the piracy activities along the Somalia area (IOTC 2010).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic this stock is exploited by three major gears/fisheries: longline (50–60%), purse seine (25%) and pole-and-line (15%) (ISSF 2010). Although there are a number of data uncertainties, including a lack of data on illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, stock assessment models estimate the MSY to be between 90,000-93,000 tonnes (ISSF 2010). Based on these projections, biomass is expected to rebuild to the MSY level in a few years if catches are maintained at or below 85,000 tonnes. It is important to note the use of high-tech FADs in the Gulf of Guinea and increases in effort due to vessels coming from the Indian Ocean, will increase already high levels of fishing mortality of juvenile Bigeye Tuna.","This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In the Pacific, several countries such as Ecuador, Colombia and Peru have created closures for this species. The vast majority of the catch is from Ecuador in this region. SPC made a recommendation to reduce catches in the Pacific. In Taiwan, the fleet has been reduced by 183 Bigeye long-line vessels (which is more than 30% of fishing capacity) (IATTC 2008). As of December 2009, NOAA has put into place catch limits for US pelagic longline fisheries in Western and Central Pacific Ocean for 2009, 2010 and 2011 having determined that the Pacific Ocean population is subject to overfishing. Under this rule, the U.S. will reduce its longline catch of Bigeye Tuna from the 2004 baseline catch of 4,181 metric tons (mt) to 3,763 mt.<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) recommends that the total catch does not exceed 85,000 t (STECF 2009). Recommendation 04-01 also implemented a new, smaller closure for the surface fishing in the area 0–5ºN, 10–20ºW during November in the Gulf of Guinea.",Decreasing,"FAO worldwide reported landings show a gradual increase from 808 tonnes in 1950 to an average of approximately 400,000–450,000 tonnes from 1996–2006 (FAO 2009). There are four stocks that are globally managed for this species. As of 2004, the stocks in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean are considered Fully Exploited, and the Eastern Pacific and Western/Central Pacific stocks are considered Over-exploited (Majkowski 2007). It is assumed that the Bigeye Tuna in the Eastern Pacific comprise a separate stock from the Western Pacific.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Eastern Pacific Ocean</span><br/>In the Eastern Pacific, annual catches although fluctuating, average 100,000–130,000 tonnes and are increasing. The expansion of the purse seine fisheries in mid 1990s has contributed to this increase in landings (STECF 2007). The stock size in 1993 is estimated to have been 34% of its unexploited size. After 1993, purse seining for tunas associated with fish-aggregating devices (FADs) took significant quantities of small and medium-sized Bigeye Tuna. In 2005, after several years of poor recruitment and excessive levels of fishing mortality, the stock size was estimated to be at about 14% of its unexploited size. Due to recent spikes in recruitment, the current level has increased to 17% (IATTC 2008). Recent catches, such as in 2008, have been above the estimated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 84,000 tonnes (ISSF 2010).<br/><br/>Previous analyses indicated that the spawning stock biomass (SSB) was below MSY, and that fishing mortality rates were about 20% greater than those corresponding to the MSY (IATTC 2008, Aires da Silva and Maunder 2007), indicating that the Bigeye Tuna stock in the Eastern Pacific was over-exploited (IATTC 2008). However, according to the most recent stock assessment conducted in 2009 (Aires da Silva and Maunder 2010), fishing mortality rates are estimated to be below the level corresponding to MSY, and the recent levels of spawning biomass are estimated to be above that level (IATTC 2010). However, these results are more pessimistic if a stock-recruitment relationship is assumed, if a higher value is assumed for the average size of the older fish, if lower rates of natural mortality are assumed for adult Bigeye Tuna, and if only the late period of the fishery (1995–2009) is included in the assessment (IATTC 2010). In addition, La Niña events may become stronger and more frequent during the period 2010–2030, and this La Niña dominance may negatively influence recruitment strength of Bigeye Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (IATTC 2010).<br/><br/>Based on linear regression of SSB estimates from the most recent 2009 stock assessment (Aires da Silva and Maunder 2010), there has been an estimated 18% decline in SSB over the past 15 years (1992–2007) in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Western and Central Pacific Ocean</span><br/>The overall trend in the Western Central Pacific Ocean is that biomass declined rapidly during the 1950s and 1960s, was relatively stable through the 1970s and 1980s, and then declined steadily from 1990 onwards (Langley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008). Adult biomass has declined by at least 20% over the last decade (STECF 2007, Langley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008). Fishing mortality has increased steadily since the introduction of commercial fishing. Current fishing mortality exceeds FMSY, and it was estimated that a 34–50% reduction from the level of fishing mortality in 2004–2007 would be needed to keep the biomass above the level corresponding to MSY (ISSF 2010). However, current bomass is also greater than BMSY. It was predicted that if fishing mortality continues at current levels, the biomass would be reduced to about half the MSY level (Harley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2010, ISSF 2010).<br/><br/>Based on linear regression of SSB estimates from the most recent 2010 stock assessment (Harley <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2010), there has been an estimated 29% decline in SSB over the past 15 years (1992–2007) in the Western and Central Pacific.

Current (2008) exploitation levels for this stock (107,000 t) are within the range of estimated MSY levels (100,000–115,000 t), although catches in the past (1997–1999) have significantly exceeded MSY. Estimated values of fishing mortality and SSB for 2008 are also close to MSY-related values, indicating a fully exploited stock (IOTC 2009).

In 1991, catch surpassed 95,000 t and continued to increase, reaching a historic high of about 133,000 t in 1994. Reported and estimated catch has been declining since then and fell below 100,000 t in 2001. This gradual decline in catch has continued, although with some fluctuations from year to year, until the most recent year of data 2009. The preliminary estimate for 2009 is 86,011 t, the highest value in the last five years. This estimate includes preliminary estimates made for a few fleets that have not yet provided data to ICCAT (SCRS ICCAT 2010).<br/><br/>In 2010, the plausible range of MSY estimated from the joint distribution using three types of abundance indices was between 78,700 and 101,600 tons (80% confidence limits) with a median MSY of 92,000 t. Historical estimates show large declines in biomass and increases in fishing mortality, especially in the mid 1990s when fishing mortality exceeded FMSY for several years.

It advocates more conservation and management measures should be implemented by the WCPFC and IATTC to minimize this risk. The group emphasizes that based on the current WCPFC and IATTC management and conservation measures, an increase in SSB is unlikely in the short term under the average low recruitment scenario.</p><p>In the Western and Central Pacific, the WCPFC has currently adopted Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) 2012-06 for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. In general, the CMM states that fishing effort for Pacific Bluefin shall stay below 2002-2004 levels except for artisanal fisheries, and that catches of juveniles (ages 0-3) shall be reduced below 2002-04 levels, except for Korea. In accordance with this CMM, Japan has instituted several catch limits on different components of the Japanese purse fishery. In 2013, the WCPFC Northern Committee has drafted a new CMM for adoption by WCPFC in December 2013. The draft CMM removes the exceptions for artisanal fisheries as well as Korean fisheries, and states that juvenile catches shall be reduced 15% below 2002–2004 levels. However, it remains unclear if the draft CMM will be adopted by WCPFC due to a reservation expressed by Korea on the removal of the exception for Korea.</p><p>    </p><p>In the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), the IATTC has adopted Resolution C-13-02 for the conservation and management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna.&#160; In general, the resolution states that the total annual commercial catch in 2014 shall not exceed 5,000 metric tons and notwithstanding the 5,000 metric ton catch limit, countries with historical EPO catches of Bluefin Tuna may in addition catch up to 500 metric tons of commercial Pacific Bluefin Tuna catch. Mexico and the US are the two countries with historical records of substantial Bluefin Tuna catches in the EPO. Mexico has quotas in place to limit the amount of fish that can be caught by individual fish ranching operations. In recent years the US catch for this species has substantially declined and historically high catches for U.S. flag vessels were due to fishing activities in Mexican waters, as evidenced by recent catches by vessel flag (IATTC 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<em><strong>Summary of Stock Status</strong></em><br/><br/>The International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) is responsible for conducting regular stock assessments for the Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The ISC created the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group (PBFWG) in 1996 with the task to assemble, conduct and analyse fisheries statistics, biological studies and stock assessments for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The West and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) are jointly in charge of the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and use the ISC stock assessment determination and advice to establish conservation and management measures.<br/><br/>The most recent stock assessment states that overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished based on several biological reference points commonly used by fisheries managers (ISC 2014). No target and limit reference points have been adopted officially by the WCPFC and IATTC, the two tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) in charge of managing the Pacific Bluefin Tuna. Based on the 2014 ISC stock assessment base case model, the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of Pacific Bluefin Tuna has fluctuated substantially over time (1952–2012) with an overall negative trend. It is estimated that the SSB in 2012 was approximately 4% of the stock’s estimated unfished SSB levels. The recruitment level in 2012 was also estimated to be relatively low (the 8th lowest in 61 years) and the average recruitment in the last five years may also be below the historical average level of recruitment. Furthermore, the stock is experiencing high exploitation levels exceeding the majority of target and limit biological reference points used by fisheries managers (ISC 2014). Furthermore, a recent tagging study estimates a natural mortality (M) median value for Pacific Bluefin Tuna aged 5 years and above to be 0.15 year<sup>-1</sup> (Whitlock <em>et al</em>. 2012). This natural mortality is lower than the value currently used in the ISC stock assessment (M=0.25 year<sup>-1</sup>).&#160; As lower natural mortality rates are associated with a less productive stock, the Pacific Bluefin Tuna may be more depleted than is presented in the ISC 2014 stock assessment.<br/><br/>In addition, there have been some concerns about the ISC stock assessment for Pacific Bluefin Tuna because the models do not adequately fit the data (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014). Yet, sensitivity analysis in the ISC models are robust to the general conclusions that the SSB is very depleted and overfishing is occurring (ISC 2014). An external analysis supported the management advice provided by the ISC stock assessment model for Pacific Bluefin Tuna, confirming that the species urgently needs new management action to ensure its sustainability (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014). The current high fishing mortality rates, including taking of juveniles, may not allow any new cohort to enter the spawning biomass. Substantial immediate cuts in fishing mortality of juveniles are needed to ensure the viability of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna, in addition to protection of spawning adults, at least until reductions in fishing mortality of juveniles allow for incorporation of new spawners (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014, ISC 2014).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Population declines calculated over a 22 year period (three generation lengths) based on SSB from 1991–2012<br/></em></strong><br/>Since 1952, spawning stock biomass (SSB) of Pacific Bluefin Tuna has fluctuated substantially, and therefore two methods were used to estimate the change in SSB over the last 22 years (three generation lengths). In the first method, a 33.2% decline was calculated based on the linear percent change in SSB between 1991 and 2012 using a 3 year average for SSB endpoints (2012 average SSB 2010-2011-2012 divided by the 1991 average SSB 1990-1991-1992). However, since the SSB time series shows many non-linear fluctuations since the 1950s, this method is highly sensitive to the generation length estimate used for its calculation. For comparison, the average annual rate of change in SSB across the entire time series from 1952 to 2012 was calculated to be -0.93% per year; assuming an exponential pattern of decline (with average annual decline of 0.93%) over the past 22 years, this yields an 18.6% decline. Alternately, the average annual rate of change in SSB over the past 22 years (1991–2012) is -1.16% per year; this yields a 22.6% decline over the past 22 years. Therefore it is estimated that there has been at least a 19–33% decline over the past 22 years (three generation lengths for this species).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Summary of Population data and stock indicators based on the 2014 ISC Stock Assessment Evaluation<br/></strong></em><strong><br/>Catch trends:</strong> Fisheries in the Pacific Ocean have targeted Pacific Bluefin Tuna for several centuries in the western Pacific and at least since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in the eastern Pacific. Data prior to 1952 is of relatively poor quality and therefore fisheries data only from 1952 to 2012 is included in the latest stock assessment (ISC 2014). Since the 1950s, catches of Pacific Bluefin Tuna have fluctuated substantially over time and by gear time. The maximum historical catch occurred in 1956 with 39,824 t and the lowest historical catch occurred in 1990 with 8,588 t. During the last 10 years, the average catch has been 21,250 t, with most of the catch (80%) occurring in the western Pacific. Since the 1950s, the catches have been predominantly composed of juveniles, and since the 1990s, the catch of age 0 has increased significantly.<br/><br/><strong>Spawning stock biomass (SSB) trends:</strong> Based on the 2014 stock assessment base case model, since 1952 the SSB of Pacific Bluefin Tuna has fluctuated substantially over time. The first year of the assessment, in 1952, the SSB was ~90,000 t. Estimates of SSB peaked at ~140,000 t in 1961, declined to ~24,000 in 1974, climbed back up to ~50,000 t in 1978, declined again to ~18,000t in 1984, climbed back up to ~87,000 in the 1995 and have fallen to about ~26,000 in 2012. It is estimated that the SSB in 2012 is approximately 4% of the stock’s estimated unfished SSB levels.<br/><br/><strong>Recruitment: </strong>Recruitment estimates (age 0 fish) have fluctuated widely with no apparent trends between 1952 and 2014. An average recruitment of 15 million fish has been estimated for the entire period of the assessment. It has been observed that average recruitment in the last five years may have been below historical average levels. The recruitment level in 2014 was estimated to be the 8th lowest in 61 years.<br/><br/><strong>Fishing mortality trends: </strong>From 1952 to 2014, the average fishing mortality for juvenile ages (0–3 ages) of Pacific Bluefin Tuna was higher than for adult ages (age 4+ fish). The more recent fishing mortality rates for ages 0-6 for the years (2009–2001) show an increase of 19% (Age 0), 4%, (Age 1), 12% (Age 2), 31% (Age 3), 60% (Age 4), 51% (Age 5) and 21% (Age 6) in respect to the fishing mortality rates for ages 0–4 in the years 2002–2004. The year 2002–2004 is the reference year for the most current WCPFC conservation and management measures in place.<br/><br/><strong>Stock status determination: </strong>No target and limit reference points have been adopted officially by the WCPFC and IATTC, the two tuna RFMOs in charge of managing the Pacific Bluefin Tuna. Yet the ISC estimated several target and limit reference points commonly used by fisheries managers to determine the status of the stock. The SSB in 2014 relative to the unfished SSB is less than 6%. Furthermore, the ratio of current fishing mortality rates (2009–2011) relative to all biological reference points indicates that current fishing mortality rate exceeds all target and limit biological reference points (Fmax, F0.1, Fmed, F10%, F20%, F30% and F40% ), except for Floss. Based on these reference points, the stock is considered overfished and overfishing is occurring.<br/><br/><strong>Future projections: </strong>The large majority of projections under different harvest scenarios and low recruitment scenarios estimate a low probability of reaching SSB benchmarks of 10% of unfished SSB (SSFf=0) within 10 years. Given recent average recruitment levels (2009–2013) may be lower than that observed before 2009, the WGPBF highlights the importance of considering the projections with low recruitment scenarios.",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Other gears such as troll, set-net, and hand-line gears can take substantial catches as well. The majority of fish are caught in purse seine fisheries (61%), followed by longline (11%) and troll (11%) (ISC 2014). Many countries harvest Pacific Bluefin Tuna, but Japan catches the majority, followed by Mexico, the USA, Korea and Chinese Taipei. The majority of the catches occur in the North Pacific Ocean, while catches in tropical waters and the southern hemisphere are relative low and sporadic. </p>  <p>Since the 1990s, the West Pacific Ocean purse seine fleet has had the largest impact on the Pacific Bluefin tuna stock compared with the west pacific coastal fisheries, the Eastern Pacific fisheries, and West Pacific longline fisheries. The catch composition of the West Pacific Ocean purse seine fisheries is made up largely of juvenile fishes.&#160; </p>  <p>In the Eastern Pacific, a considerable portion of the purse seine catch is transported to holding pens in the Ensenada region of Northern Baja California, Mexico for fattening and later sale as sashimi grade fish (IATTC 2008). Tuna ranching was evaluated by a Bi-National Scientific Team funded by the Packard Foundation (Zertuche-Gonzalez<em> et al.</em> 2008). </p>  <p>Since the early 1990s, the increase of catches of juveniles of age 0 has substantially increased; which may be an indicator of the increasing fishery pressure on this species (ISC 2014). The increasing value of this species may be another indicator of the increasing fishery pressure on this species. The price of the first big bluefin brought into the Tokyo Tsukiji market, an annual event intended to generate publicity, has substantially increased each year: $396,000, 341 kg (2011), $735,000, 269 kg (2012), $1,800,000, 222 kg (2013).&#160;</p>","<p>To<strong> </strong>lower the probability of SSB falling further below its historical lowest levels, the WGPBF advice is to<strong> </strong>substantially reduce fishing mortality and catches for the whole range of juvenile ages. Given the average low recruitment levels for the last 5 years, the WGPBF advises that the risk of SSB falling to its lowest observed levels might increase. It advocates more conservation and management measures should be implemented by the WCPFC and IATTC to minimize this risk. The group emphasizes that based on the current WCPFC and IATTC management and conservation measures, an increase in SSB is unlikely in the short term under the average low recruitment scenario.</p><p>In the Western and Central Pacific, the WCPFC has currently adopted Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) 2012-06 for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. In general, the CMM states that fishing effort for Pacific Bluefin shall stay below 2002-2004 levels except for artisanal fisheries, and that catches of juveniles (ages 0-3) shall be reduced below 2002-04 levels, except for Korea. In accordance with this CMM, Japan has instituted several catch limits on different components of the Japanese purse fishery. In 2013, the WCPFC Northern Committee has drafted a new CMM for adoption by WCPFC in December 2013. The draft CMM removes the exceptions for artisanal fisheries as well as Korean fisheries, and states that juvenile catches shall be reduced 15% below 2002–2004 levels. However, it remains unclear if the draft CMM will be adopted by WCPFC due to a reservation expressed by Korea on the removal of the exception for Korea.</p><p>    </p><p>In the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), the IATTC has adopted Resolution C-13-02 for the conservation and management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna.&#160; In general, the resolution states that the total annual commercial catch in 2014 shall not exceed 5,000 metric tons and notwithstanding the 5,000 metric ton catch limit, countries with historical EPO catches of Bluefin Tuna may in addition catch up to 500 metric tons of commercial Pacific Bluefin Tuna catch. Mexico and the US are the two countries with historical records of substantial Bluefin Tuna catches in the EPO. Mexico has quotas in place to limit the amount of fish that can be caught by individual fish ranching operations. In recent years the US catch for this species has substantially declined and historically high catches for U.S. flag vessels were due to fishing activities in Mexican waters, as evidenced by recent catches by vessel flag (IATTC 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<em><strong>Summary of Stock Status</strong></em><br/><br/>The International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) is responsible for conducting regular stock assessments for the Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The ISC created the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group (PBFWG) in 1996 with the task to assemble, conduct and analyse fisheries statistics, biological studies and stock assessments for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The West and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) are jointly in charge of the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and use the ISC stock assessment determination and advice to establish conservation and management measures.<br/><br/>The most recent stock assessment states that overfishing is occurring and the stock is overfished based on several biological reference points commonly used by fisheries managers (ISC 2014). No target and limit reference points have been adopted officially by the WCPFC and IATTC, the two tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) in charge of managing the Pacific Bluefin Tuna. Based on the 2014 ISC stock assessment base case model, the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of Pacific Bluefin Tuna has fluctuated substantially over time (1952–2012) with an overall negative trend. It is estimated that the SSB in 2012 was approximately 4% of the stock’s estimated unfished SSB levels. The recruitment level in 2012 was also estimated to be relatively low (the 8th lowest in 61 years) and the average recruitment in the last five years may also be below the historical average level of recruitment. Furthermore, the stock is experiencing high exploitation levels exceeding the majority of target and limit biological reference points used by fisheries managers (ISC 2014). Furthermore, a recent tagging study estimates a natural mortality (M) median value for Pacific Bluefin Tuna aged 5 years and above to be 0.15 year<sup>-1</sup> (Whitlock <em>et al</em>. 2012). This natural mortality is lower than the value currently used in the ISC stock assessment (M=0.25 year<sup>-1</sup>).&#160; As lower natural mortality rates are associated with a less productive stock, the Pacific Bluefin Tuna may be more depleted than is presented in the ISC 2014 stock assessment.<br/><br/>In addition, there have been some concerns about the ISC stock assessment for Pacific Bluefin Tuna because the models do not adequately fit the data (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014). Yet, sensitivity analysis in the ISC models are robust to the general conclusions that the SSB is very depleted and overfishing is occurring (ISC 2014). An external analysis supported the management advice provided by the ISC stock assessment model for Pacific Bluefin Tuna, confirming that the species urgently needs new management action to ensure its sustainability (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014). The current high fishing mortality rates, including taking of juveniles, may not allow any new cohort to enter the spawning biomass. Substantial immediate cuts in fishing mortality of juveniles are needed to ensure the viability of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna, in addition to protection of spawning adults, at least until reductions in fishing mortality of juveniles allow for incorporation of new spawners (Maunder <em>et al</em>. 2014, ISC 2014).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Population declines calculated over a 22 year period (three generation lengths) based on SSB from 1991–2012<br/></em></strong><br/>Since 1952, spawning stock biomass (SSB) of Pacific Bluefin Tuna has fluctuated substantially, and therefore two methods were used to estimate the change in SSB over the last 22 years (three generation lengths). In the first method, a 33.2% decline was calculated based on the linear percent change in SSB between 1991 and 2012 using a 3 year average for SSB endpoints (2012 average SSB 2010-2011-2012 divided by the 1991 average SSB 1990-1991-1992). However, since the SSB time series shows many non-linear fluctuations since the 1950s, this method is highly sensitive to the generation length estimate used for its calculation. For comparison, the average annual rate of change in SSB across the entire time series from 1952 to 2012 was calculated to be -0.93% per year; assuming an exponential pattern of decline (with average annual decline of 0.93%) over the past 22 years, this yields an 18.6% decline. Alternately, the average annual rate of change in SSB over the past 22 years (1991–2012) is -1.16% per year; this yields a 22.6% decline over the past 22 years. Therefore it is estimated that there has been at least a 19–33% decline over the past 22 years (three generation lengths for this species).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Summary of Population data and stock indicators based on the 2014 ISC Stock Assessment Evaluation<br/></strong></em><strong><br/>Catch trends:</strong> Fisheries in the Pacific Ocean have targeted Pacific Bluefin Tuna for several centuries in the western Pacific and at least since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in the eastern Pacific.

Recent trends since 2003 reflect the changes in fishing mortality with a decrease in biomass on the Atlantic coast and an increase on the Gulf coast.&#160;Stock assessments (2005) for the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts in Florida indicate that the stock is not currently overfished as population biomass estimates exceeded the estimated minimum stock size threshold. There was a mixed fishery of permit and pompano off Florida until the 20-inch limit came into effect, which makes the commercial landings trend difficult to discern prior to this time.&#160;A recent stock assessment indicates that this species is overfished off the Florida Atlantic coast (Solomon and Tremain 2009). A&#160;stock reduction analysis suggested that fishing is too high contrary to the surplus production model which showed fishing rates below the overfishing threshold. In addition,&#160;highly uncertain but low estimates of static spawning potential ratio for the Atlantic coast in 2005 (25%) seemingly supports an overfishing status designation there (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

The northern Benguela Current ecosystem itself underwent a major shift in the 1970's and 1980's, where the system was previously dominated by sardines and anchovies, dominance shifted to cape horse mackerel, hake, bearded goby and jellyfish (Cury and Shannon 2004).&#160;Fishing effort targeting this species increased significantly from 1970 to 1980 due to the advent of freezer technology on board large purse seine and trawl vessels&#160;(Akawa and Nashima 2014).&#160;Due to difficulties associated with the species' vertical migration behaviours and coastal migration patterns, it has been challenging to accurately estimate this species abundance&#160;in traditional&#160;stock assessment models&#160;(Barange&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998,&#160;Kirchner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, DAFF 2015).<strong><br/> <strong><br/></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>South African stock:&#160;</strong></strong><em>Trachurus capensis</em> began to be targeted by commercial purse seiners off South Africa in the mid 1940's. The purse seine fishery peaked in 1954, at which point it was the largest catch in South African fisheries, and gradual declines thereafter caused the fishery to shift its main target to other species by the 1970's (Naish <em>et al. </em>1991, Barange <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;Both juveniles and adults were caught until the mid 1960's, after which the catch was comprised mainly of juveniles (Naish&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991).&#160;By 1982, foreign trawlers no longer targeted the cape horse mackerel resource&#160;(Barange&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998).&#160;The inshore demersal trawl fishery off southeastern South Africa began operation in 1929 and between 1967 to 1975, this species comprised 40.5% of the total catch. After a peak in catch in 1977, biomass became severely depleted (Hecht 1990). After foreign fleets stopped fishing South African waters in 1991, annual catch declined to 20,000-30,000 tons and did not increase again until 1997 upon the&#160;re-establishment of a mid-water fishery. Large surface schools of adult horse mackerel targeted by the early purse-seine fleet have now disappeared from the South African west coast, which led to catches being mostly comprised of juveniles by the 1990's. To reduce pressure, a precautionary maximum catch limit was implemented in 2000, and the annual purse seine catch of juveniles has averaged 3,676 tons ever since&#160;(DAFF 2015).&#160;Targeted effort&#160;on the Agulhas Bank on the adult stock&#160;is now limited to&#160;only a few&#160;permitted&#160;large mid–water trawlers (Kirchner 2012). The current status of the stock&#160;is considered to be good, and well above Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level (Furman 2014, de Moor <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;According to the most recent Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) report on the horse mackerel fishery, abundance increased&#160;by 20%&#160;from 2010 to 2015, but catch rates have declined substantially (DAFF 2015). The most recent estimates of spawning stock biomass have been projected via two models to be at either 69% or 18%&#160;of the carrying capacity,&#160;abundance survey indices&#160;show a declining trend since 1985&#160;and CPUE models show a significant decline since 2013&#160;(Johnston and Butterworth 2016).

In response, the trawl fishery was closed in 2002 and the TAC has been reduced annually due to the lack of recovery (Kirchner 2012). Estimated biomass in Angola declined significantly in&#160;2001 after an intense El Niňo occurred between 1999 and 2000 and an even further decline has occurred since 2006, with the lowest estimate in 2008 (Kirchner 2012).<br/> Landings&#160;in the Namibian horse mackerel purse seine fishery&#160;between 1950 to 2006 peaked from the early 1970's to the late 1980's, was considered fully exploited from 1980 to 1985, and subsequently over-exploited until 1990&#160;(Akawa and Nashima 2014).

Despite low biomass in 2006-2007, the level&#160;has remained fairly high and constant from 2009-2011 and the average catch–at–length increased from 20 cm in 2007, to about 22 cm in 2008 and to 25 cm in 2009 and 2010 (Kirchner 2012).&#160;Kirchner&#160;<em>et al</em>.

In the 1990s, declines in surface schools of Common Jack Mackerel in Tasmanian waters was considered to be due to heavy fishing pressure during the 1980s to 1990s. However, the main driver of fluctuations in population and/or catch is now understood to have been a shift in the main prey of&#160;<em>T. declivis</em>, Australian Krill (<em>Nyctiphanes australis</em>) due to the strengthening of the East Australian Current, which altered the swarming behaviour and abundance of krill (Young<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1993, McLeod<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, Goldsworthy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).

Spawning biomass is estimated&#160;and catch limits subsequently set for the eastern Australia fishery based on&#160;the daily egg production method (Sexton <em>et al</em>. 2017), and was estimated to be 157,805 tons in January 2014 (Ward <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;The eastern Australia stock<strong>&#160;</strong>was considered to be sustainably fished in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, with recently low catches reflective of low fishing effort, not low abundance. Total catch was 317 tons in 2014-2015. In addition, recent catches have been less than one per cent of the estimated spawning biomass, and well below the sustainable exploitation rate proposed as a target for this species (Ward <em>et al. </em>2012, Ward <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ward <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ward and Grammer 2016, Ward <em>et al. </em>2016). In New South Wales, eastern Australia, there are currently only six active vessels in the ocean trawl fishery and recreational catch is negligible (Ward<em> et al.</em> 2016). Long term catch trends are likely the result of changes in fish abundance as well as economic factors. The impact of fishing on the population is poorly understood, and is complicated by large inter-annual variability in oceanographic conditions which this species is known to respond to (McLeod<em> et al.</em> 2012, Ward and Grammer 2016).&#160;<strong>The western Australia stock:&#160;</strong>Historically, catches in the western area have been lower than those in the eastern. A lack of data on the western stock prevents an estimate of spawning biomass. However, total catch has not exceeded 400 tons since 1997-1998 and catch in 2014-2015 was less than one ton, and was mainly comprised of sexually mature fish. Similar to the eastern stock, low catches are reflective of low fishing effort, not abundance, and the fishery is considered sustainable (Ward and Grammer 2016). <strong>The New Zealand stock:</strong>&#160;Commercial catches of jack mackerel in New Zealand are comprised of three species: <em>T. declivis</em>, <em>T. novaezelandiae</em> and <em>T. murphyi</em>. Catch is not reported at the species level, and studies have found that the dominant species in the catch, as compared to the other two, varies by year and locality. In the recent decade,&#160;<em>T. novaezelandiae </em>has been the dominant species (75% of the catch), and catch estimates for <em>T. declivis</em> and <em>T. murphyi</em> are relatively low and considerably less precise. During 2010/2011 to 2013/2014, <em>T. declivis</em> was estimated to comprise less than 10% of the total catch (Langley <em>et al</em>. 2016). Over the past decade, total commercial catch has ranged between 81 to 98% of the 10,000 ton total allowable catch (TAC) limit and the annual recreational harvest is estimated at 100 tons (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Declines in landings are attributed to&#160;declining abundance of&#160;<em>T. murphyi</em>, which is non-native to New Zealand.&#160;The TAC was reduced somewhat for the 2016/2017 fishing year. The most recent assessment&#160;of this fishery reports that, despite the lack of some key data, over-fishing is not likely to be occurring (New Zealand Fisheries Assessment Plenary 2017).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_not_th

In the southern East China Sea, sea surface temperature has been increasing significantly since the 1980's, particularly in winter due to climate change (Liu and Zhang 2013). Since this species relies on favourable water temperatures for spawning and recruitment in this region, there are concerns for future population decline due to environmental changes (Lu and Lee 2014).","The Japanese government introduced a total allowable catch (TAC) limit in 1997 (Yoda <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Korean fishery has been managed with a TAC limit since 1999 (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014). Management is needed to reduce the capture of immature and spawning individuals in the Taiwanese fishery (Lu<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). A joint international fishery management and stock assessment program is needed for this species (Zhang and Lee 2001, Yoda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).",Decreasing,"<p>Genetic studies indicate that there is a single panmictic population for this species across the waters of Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan (Song&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is fished in the East China Sea, along the Pacific coast of southern Japan and in the western Sea of Japan (Sassa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Sassa <em>et al.</em> 2016). Survival from the larval to juvenile stages varies inter-annually depending on environmental conditions in the Kuroshio Current system, which can impact recruitment success (Sassa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). According to annual FAO landings statistics for 'Japanese jack mackerel' reported by Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China, catch peaked between 1960-1965 and steeply declined afterwards. Catch has been on a generally increasing trend since 1980, but has not reached historical peak catches (FAO FishStatJ database accessed June 2017). Over the past three generation lengths, which is estimated as nine years and a time period from 2006-2015, total catch reported to FAO declined by 27%, from 324,975 tons in 2006 to 236,716 in 2015. This catch decline appears to be largely driven by Chinese catch. Although trends in Chinese effort are not known, it is suspected that effort is stable or increasing.&#160;During the early to mid 1960's, Japanese catches were at 450,000 to 550,000 metric tons, but declined sharply starting in 1967 to 50,000 thousand metric tons in 1980 due to to over-exploitation (Song <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, the fishery has gradually recovered since the late 1980's, with catch during 1990–2001 reaching 210,000 to 330,000 metric tons in southern Japan (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). From 1980–2013, catches in Japanese fisheries fluctuated widely between 50,000 to 319,000 metric tons (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and in general experience decadal shifts in catch (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Korean catch also declined in the 1960's to below 10,000 metric tons and then increased in the early 1980's to 23,000 metric tons (Zhang and Lee 2001).&#160;<br/> This species occurred in 77% of the hauls and comprised 5% of the catch in a trawl survey conducted from 2006 to 2013&#160;in the Common Fishing Zone between Vietnam and China in the Gulf of Tonkin (Nguyen 2015). This species is abundant, and typically accounts for approximately 80% of the entire fish community from February to December off Geumo Island, South Korea (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2016). In 2012, the total allowable catch limit for Korea was 21,000 metric tons (Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).

It is caught with trawls and seines. FAO (2003) reported that in the southern part of the Alboran Sea the stock status of <em>T. trachurus</em> was fully exploited.  In the Mediterranean Sea it is caught mostly by purse seine and bottom trawl but also by hand line. This species is also targeted by the recreational fishery.&#160;According to an assessment review by FAO (2005) this species is fully exploited in the Mediterranean and is also heavily exploited in the Black Sea. This species is imported and is considered a highly-prized species in many West African countries. Due to high demand, it is imported from Mauritania. Beach seine captures smaller-sized species (Nunoo and Quartey pers. comm. 2013). In Senegal, this species is caught in very small quantities and there are no data available. It represents not even one percent of the total catch in scientific surveys (Sylla pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>Stocks of&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>, and of fishes of the genus&#160;<em>Trachurus</em>, are particularly difficult to assess. Ageing is difficult (Abaunza <em>et al. </em>2003). Additionally, several stocks, such as the western horse mackerel stock, are characterized by spasmodic recruitment, that is, good recruitment only once in a generation. Additionally, <em>T. trachurus</em>, like other members of the genus, is likely an indeterminate spawner and therefore total fecundity is unknown. The strength of a year class cannot be confirmed before it is fully recruited to the fishery and has reached the age of five years. The only fishery-independent data available are based on triennial egg surveys. For these reasons, recommended Total Allowable Catches (TAC) are advised to remain conservative (Roel and De Oliveira 2007). It has been suggested that management of small pelagics by effort control alone may not control the exploitation rate. This species is not subject to TAC restrictions in the Mediterranean (STECF advice 2013).","<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;is a commercially important species which is managed to varying degrees throughout its range. Management efforts in the Mediterranean are perceived as being somewhat less effective overall. It has been suggested that the management of this species through effort control alone may not be effective in the Mediterranean, and that catch limits are a more effective means of managing this species. The EU minimum size 15 cm TL. Turkey has a closed season from the end of April to the beginning of September and also minimum size limit of 13 cm TL (STECF 2014). This species is overexploited in Mauritania with a recommendation to cut the effort (Camara pers. comm. 2013).",Decreasing,"Globally reported catches of this species have remained relatively stable or increasing over the past 30-35 years, with an average of over 55,000,000 metric tonnes in the early 1980s (1981-1983) to an average of 68,000,000 tonnes (2011-2013). Drastic reductions in catch were seen in the late 1980s, from 8,000,000 tonnes to about 160,000 tonnes, which were likely due to changes in regulations, as well as better disaggregated reporting for this species (FAO FishStat 2015). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic,&#160;<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;is divided into three stocks, in order of decreasing biomass: the northwestern horse mackerel in the Norwegian sea, northern North Sea, west and south of the British Isles, western English Channel, and west of France; the southern horse mackerel around the Iberian peninsula; and the North Sea horse mackerel, restricted to the central and southern parts of the North Sea and eastern English Channel (Abaunza&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003). The status of the&#160;<em>T. trachurus&#160;</em>stock in the North Sea is unknown. Landings have been decreasing in the North Sea, however this is likely due to reductions in fishing effort. In division IXa this species is caught in mixed fisheries, and fishing pressure has on average been below Fmsy. However, Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) has decreased gradually since 2007 and is at around 30% below the long term average.&#160;There is no stock assessment information available from Madeira or the Canary Islands. For the Western Stock, which is the largest stock in the North Atlantic, SSB has varied between 0.65 and 1.7 million tonnes between 1995 and 2012 and was estimated to be at 0.84 million tonnes in 2013 (ICES Advice 2013). The western&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;stock (ICES divisions IIa, Iva, Vb, Via, VIIa-c, e-k, and VIIIa-e)&#160;is experiencing fishing pressure which is above the target Fmsy, and SSB is qualitatively evaluated as declining. Fishing mortality on younger ages has reached record high levels (Casey <em>et. al. </em>2014). In the Mediterranean, FAO statistics for this species are incomplete as they are most probably mixed with <em>T. mediterraneus</em>. In the Mediterranean, the bulk of the catches come from Turkey, the Sea of Marmara and western Black Sea.  The landings appear to be stable in the Mediterranean Sea. In Turkey, however, it is overfished as evidenced by only younger age classes appearing in the catch (zero to one year age class; C. Bizsel pers. comm. 2007).&#160;<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;in the southern Alboran Sea has no available SSB estimates, and no reference points, however landing restrictions as a more effective management tool for small pelagics in the Mediterranean have been proposed (Casey <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Eastern Central Atlantic</strong><br/>Overall reported captures for this species in the Eastern Central Atlantic reached a high of 550,000 tonnes in 1995, and have since declined to approximately 200,000 tonnes in 2010 (FAO Fishfinder, Species Datasheet). However, <em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;is considered overexploited (CECAF 2011) from Senegal and northwards, and&#160;Mauritania stock assessments indicate overexploitation. From 1958 to 1990, overall catches in the Eastern Central Atlantic are&#160;fluctuating with two recorded peaks: in 1981 (22,790 metric tonnes) and 1987 (20,964 metric tonnes). However, catch records from 1991-2011 show very low reports (some reporting zero catches). and average catches in the Eastern Central Atlantic over the last nine years have been very low, dropping from averages of 700 metric tonnes/year in 1999-2001 to only 20 metric tonnes in 2007-2011. It is assumed that effort for this species has not decreased over this time period. Overall, in this portion of its range, catches have declined by more than 90%, from an average of 15,000-20,000 metric tonnes per year in the mid 1980s to just 20 metric tonnes in the past three years (2009-2011) over the past three generation lengths (or 30 years).&#160;In 2010, it was considered&#160;257% overexploited based on fishing mortality (F current/F 0.1; CECAF northern working group 2011).&#160;In this region, the Saharo-Mauritanian stock size has substantially decreased &#160;due to fishing pressure and weak recruitment (Abaunza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>In the ECA, there is no confusion in terms of taxonomic identification between <em>T. trachurus </em>and <em>T. trecae</em>, however, in the region, catch of the two species are often lumped in mixed catches. However, in general,&#160;<em>T. trecae</em>&#160;is more abundant from Mauritania south and&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;is considered a more European species and is more abundant in the northern part of its range. In the southern portion of this species range, from Guinea Bissau to Angola, the&#160;CECAF working group evaluates T<em>rachurus </em>species and it is estimated that the majority of the catch is comprised of&#160;<em>T. trecae</em>.<br/><br/>Karaiskou<em>&#160;et al. </em>(2004) examined the population structure of&#160;<em>T. picturatus, T. mediterraneus</em> and&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;using mitochondrial control region. They found no sign of Atlantic-Mediterranean division in any of species, which was attributed to the ability of&#160;<em>Trachurus&#160;</em>species to migrate long distances, and to flexibility to oceanographical constraints. Allozyme analysis showed that of all&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em> subpopulations studied from across this species' known range were genetically homogeneous, connected by high levels of gene flow. There was only slight differentiation between eastern and western Mediterranean samples versus the western Mediterranean and Atlantic samples. Additionally, genetic variability in this species was found to be very high, among the highest recorded in the literature for many pelagic and demersal species, and the genetic structure was found to be stable over time. It is worth noting that the lowest levels of genetic variability were found in the heavily-exploited northwestern stock, corroborating information seen ICES analytical assessments of the stock (Cimmaruta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).",Marine,yes,Teleost,spp_th

Throughout the Eastern Central Atlantic, catches have been fluctuating but have been relatively stable since ~1990 with some regions reporting increased CPUE (e.g., Mauritania). In some countries (e.g., Ghana and other countries in the region), this species is being imported from Mauritania and Senegal since local catches are unable to meet the high demand. Nansen Survey from Nigeria-Gabon in 2006, collected this species in pelgaic and demersal trawls at depths of 22-104 m, with a catch rate of 1,245 kg/hour. In 2011, Nansen Survey from&#160;Senegal and Gambia collected this species&#160;at a depth of 158 m under a catch rate of 24.23 kg/hour at 24 m (Mor pers. comm. 2013, Sidibe pers. comm. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In Senegal, this species is a component of the small pelagic mixed catch fishery, where there is seasonal variation in catch landings in artisanal fisheries with &gt;100-fold catch in the colder season than in the warmer season (Mor pers. comm. 2013, Sidibe pers. comm. 2013). The industrial fisheries of Senegal landed 12 tonnes annually of this species in 2011 and the artisanal fishery landed 18,535 tonnes. <em>Trachurus trecae</em> is harvested by purse seines and available information from Senegal does not indicate changes in market availability (Sidibe and Sylla Mor pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Mauritania, scientific surveys from 2002-2009 catches show a trend of gradually increasing catches from 94,000-216,000 mt, with the sub-region catch data from 1990-2008 fluctuating from a low of about 59,000 mt to a high of about 200,000 mt and then down again to 40,000 mt in 2008 (Camara pers. comm. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Overall, cumulative catch data from the region show a relatively stable, but fluctuating trend from 525 to 29,966 mt based on catches ranging from 552-2,171 mt in Guinea (1990-2007), from 34-3,290 mt in Nigeria (1990-1993), from 20-92 mt in Congo, and 2-50 mt in Liberia (1997-2007).

Swordfish are caught by longline, harpoon, drift gill net, set net and other fishing gear in commercial fisheries. For the most part, swordfish captures are incidental in tuna longline fisheries. Major sport fishery areas, trolling, and drifted baited lines are located off the coast of California to Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile (Nakamura 1985). In the Mediterranean Sea, it is mostly caught by drift nets, long lines, but also by harpoons, tuna traps and sport and recreational fisheries. It is a good food fish, marketed fresh or frozen.<br/><br/>The largest proportion of Atlantic catches are made using surface drifting longlines, mostly by Spain, United States, Canada and Portugal. However, many additional gears are used (STECF 2009). Other directed swordfish fisheries include fleets from Brazil, Morocco, Namibia, EC-Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The primary by-catch or opportunistic fisheries that take swordfish are tuna fleets from Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and EC-France. The tuna longline fishery started in 1956 and has operated throughout the Atlantic since then, with substantial catches of swordfish that are produced as a bycatch of tuna fisheries (ICCAT 2009). In the Atlantic, the Mediterranean stock is considered to be overfished and that overfishing is occurring. The stocks of the North and South Atlantic are considered to be well-managed (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific the main fisheries are Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan has had stable standardized CPUE trends, and Japan has shown variable CPUE trends depending on the fishing area (IOTC 2009). The Indian Ocean, Western Central Pacific and Southeastern Pacific are similarly considered to be under adequate management at present (fishing mortality below Fmsy and biomass above Bmsy; Kolody <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008, IOTC 2009, Hinton and Maunder 2006).","This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Atlantic</span><br/>There have been some changes in U.S. regulations which may have impacted catch rates, but the effects of these remain unknown. It is important to note that since 2003 the catches have been below the total allowable catches (TACs), greatly increasing chances of a fast recovery (STECF 2009). The total allowable catch in the North Atlantic during the 2007–2008 period was 14,000 t per year. The reported catch during that period averaged 11,536 t and did not exceed the TAC in any year. The total allowable catch in the South Atlantic for the years 2007 through 2008 was 17,000 t. The reported catch during that period averaged 13,365, and did not exceed the TAC in any year. There are two minimum size options that are applied to the entire Atlantic: 125 cm LJFL with a 15% tolerance, or 119 cm LJFL with zero tolerance and evaluation of the discards.<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">North Atlantic</span><br/>Since 1994 there have been quotas and minimum size limits to restrict the harvest of north Atlantic Swordfish. There are also longline area closures in place in the U.S. Atlantic. Reduced landings have been attributed to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) regulatory recommendations and shifts in fleet distributions, including the movement of some vessels some years to the South Atlantic or out of the Atlantic. In addition, some fleets, including the United States, EC-Spain, EC-Portugal and Canada, have changed operating procedures to opportunistically target tuna and/or sharks, taking advantage of market conditions and higher relative catch rates of these species previously considered as by-catch in some fleets. Recently, socio-economic factors may have also contributed to the decline in catch. Consistent with the goal of the Commission’s swordfish rebuilding plan (Rec. 96-02), in order to maintain the northern Atlantic Swordfish stock at a level that could produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with greater than 50% probability, the Committee recommends reducing catch limits allowed by Rec. 06-02 (15,345 t) to no more than 13,700 t. This reflects the current best estimate of maximum yield that could be harvested from the population under existing environmental and fishery conditions. Should the Commission wish to have greater assurance that future biomass would be at or above BMSY while maintaining F at or below FMSY, the Commission should select a lower annual TAC, depending on the degree of precaution the Commission chooses to apply in management. The Committee noted that allowable catch levels agreed in (Recs. 06-02 and 08-02) exceeded scientific recommendations. The successful rebuilding of this stock could have been compromised if recent catches had been higher than realized. Because of the poor size-selectivity of longliners, regulating minimum landing size may inadvertently have resulted in under-reporting of juvenile catches. Alternative methods for reducing juvenile catches, such as time and/or area closures or technological changes in gear deployment, may be more effective and their utility should be further investigated (STECF 2009). Future TACs above MSY are projected to result in 50% or lower probabilities of the stock biomass remaining above BMSY over the next decade (SWO-ATL-Figure 13) as the resulting probability of F exceeding FMSY for these scenarios would trend above 50% over time. A TAC of 13,000 t would provide approximately a 75% probability of maintaining the stock at a level consistent with the Convention Objective over the next decade (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">South Atlantic</span> <br/>Until more research has been conducted to reduce the high uncertainty in stock status evaluations for the southern Atlantic swordfish stock, the Committee emphasizes that annual catch should not exceed the provisionally estimated MSY (15,000). Considering the unquantified uncertainties and the conflicting indications for the stock, the Committee recommends a more precautionary Fishery Management approach, to limit catches to the recent average level (~15,000 t), which are expected to maintain the catch rates at about their current level (STECF 2009). In general, catches of 14,000 t or less will result in increases in the biomass of the stock, catches on the order of 15,000 will maintain the biomass of the stock at approximately stable levels during the period projected. Catches in the order of 16,000 t or more will result in biomass decrease. The current TAC is 17,000 t (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Mediterranean Sea</span><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, there are minimum size regulations, such as 90cm lower jaw-fork length in Spain, 140 upper jaw fork-length in Italy, 130 UJFL in Turkey. However, these minimum size regulations were cancelled because it was considered ineffective as a management tool. In Greece, the fishing season is closed from October to January. In 2009, ICCAT adopted a closed season for the Mediterranean Sea from 1 October to 31 November. The EU has banned all drift nets since January 2002 and ICCAT banned them since 2005 (some illegal drift nets still occur).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Pacific</span><br/>In Chile there is a size limit for this species, and total effort for this species has declined as they moved from driftnets to longlines. However, recent catches in this region are mostly targeted by the Spanish fleet. Given the potential for rapid change in the nature of the gill-net and longline fisheries that are increasingly targeting swordfish in the Eastern Pacific region, the trends in standardized catch per unit effort should be closely monitored for indications of changing status of these stocks (Hinton 2003, Hinton and Maunder 2006). The Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission has recommended to limit the number of boats as well as catch and effort for the southwestern stock (WCPFC 2008).<br/><br/><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">Indian</span><br/>The Scientific Committee recommends that management measures focused on controlling and/or reducing effort in the fishery targeting Swordfish in the southwest Indian Ocean be implemented (IOTC 2006).",Decreasing,"The Atlantic population is comprised of three stocks that are genetically distinct: South Atlantic, North Atlantic and Mediterranean. The best scientific evidence indicates that there are four stocks of Swordfish in the Pacific Ocean (Hinton and Alvarado Bremer 2007), with centres in the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The Indian Ocean population is currently assessed as a single management unit.<br/><br/>The North Atlantic stock of Swordfish is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ICCAT 2009). The stock is rebuilding with current biomass levels increasing by 4.4% over a three generation length period based on the ASPIC base case (Figure 20, ICCAT 2009). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>The South Atlantic stock was overfished and overfishing had been occurring, but at present, fishing mortality is below FMSY, stock biomass is slightly above BMSY and under current management quotas (13,700 t TAC), the stock is projected to remain above the BMSY and slightly rebuild further (ICCAT 2009). The reduction in biomass for the South Atlantic stock over three generations has been approximately 30.3% based on the ASPIC base case (Figure 30, ICCAT 2009). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>The Mediterranean stock is currently considered to be overfished and stock is experiencing slight overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT-SCRS) report that the Mediterranean Sea swordfish compose a unique stock separated from the Atlantic, although more research is needed to clearly define the stock boundaries. Mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Kotoulas <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 1995). The spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2008 was 46% below the value that would maximize yield-per-recruit. In addition, the majority of the catch includes juveniles. However, landings statistics and population parameters indicate a certain stability over the past 20 years. The estimated decline in total biomass over a three generation period (20 years) ranged from 27–50% depending on whether a regression line or first and last points of the data series were used (Figure 21, ICCAT 2010). The Mediterranean population of Swordfish was therefore regionally assessed as Near Threatened in an overview of the conservation status of Mediterranean fishes (Abdul Malak <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2011). This stock is not considered to be well-managed.<br/><br/>In the North Pacific, a two-stock scenario analysing the western and central Pacific (subarea 1) and the eastern Pacific (subarea 2) was considered the most plausible based on analyses of Japanese longline catch per unit data (CPUE) data. Using the two-stock Bayesian production model (Brodziak and Ishimura 2009), a decline of 43.9% was estimated for subarea 1, and an increase of 111.2% in subarea 2 over a three generation length period (20 years). The decline was calculated using a linear regression over the time period considered. The results indicate that the North Pacific population is stable (Brodziak and Ishimura 2010).<br/><br/>In the Western Central Pacific, a MULTIFAN-CL stock assessment of south-west Pacific Swordfish showed a decline in total biomass ranging from 25.7% (optimistic scenario) to 36.9% (pessimistic scenario) over three generation lengths (20 years) (Figure 29, Kolody <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">et al</span>. 2008). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>In the Southeastern Pacific, spawning biomass is estimated to have increased by 3.3% over three generation lengths (Figure 4.4, Hinton and Maunder 2006). The percent change was calculated using a linear regression over the time period considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>For the Indian Ocean, an ASPIC model showed a decline in total biomass of 57.8% over the last three generation lengths (20 years) (Figure 59, IOTC 2010). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The model results indicate that biomass is close to the BMSY level, and that overfishing is not presently occurring. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>Globally, this species has shown a 28% decline over three generation lengths (20 years).

These two species are not separated in catch landing statistics (Roa and Ernest 1999, 2000). Between 1999 and 2000 there was an important increase in mainly artisanal landings, with a maximum landing of 4,151 t during 2000, which then dropped to 3,000 t in 2001 (SERNAPESCA 1989-2003). In Chile, overall biomass has decreased by 51% and spawning biomass has decreased by 34% since fishing began in 1979 (Quiroz 2005). <br/> <br/>In the artisanal multispecies longline fishery off Central and Southern Chile (39°15' to 41°28.6'S) the catch is regulated by quota for <em>Z. chilensis</em> and <em>D. trachydermus</em>. Since 2000, 30% of artisanal landings within this fishery (between IX and X Regions) have been monitored (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002). Landings comprise 85% <em>Z. chilensis</em>, 10% <em>D. trachydermus</em>, with the remaining 5% made up of <em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>, <em>B. brachyurops, B. griseocauda</em> and <em>Rajella sadowskyii</em> (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002). <br/> <br/>South of the above-mentioned fishing grounds (that is, south of 41°28.6'S), both <em>Z. chilensis</em> and <em>D. trachydermus</em> are taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries for southern hake <em>Merluccius australis</em> and in artisanal fisheries for golden kingclip <em>Genypterus blacodes</em>. Captures in 2002 were of ~2,000 t for both <em>Dipturus</em> <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">trachydermus</span> and <em>Zearaja chilensis</em> combined and since 2005 there have been quotas put in place in these southern fishing grounds.<br/> <br/>Off southern Chile, artisanal fishing activities generally only operate close to small towns such as Chiloé, Aysén and Punta Arenas and as such there may be some refuge for the species in the extensive coastline of southern Chile which consists of many fjords and canals where fishing activities are not operating at present.<br/> <br/><em>Zearaja chilensis</em> is also a minor bycatch of the Chilean deepsea crustacean fisheries for yellow squat lobster <em>Cervimunida johni</em> and deepsea shrimp <em>Heterocarpus reedi</em> (Acuña and Villarroel 2002).<br/> <br/><strong>Argentina and Uruguay</strong> <br/>In the coastal and continental shelf waters of Argentina, fishing pressure on all skate species is rising due to increasing demand on the international market. Subsequently, catches have been rising since 1994. Skates, principally <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Z</span><em>. chilensis</em>, are directly targeted by a licensed Korean longliner on the continental shelf off Mar del Plata, Argentina (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2002) and are also taken in coastal fisheries (Massa<em> et al.</em> 2004a, b). While, species-specific catch time-series for these fisheries are unavailable, skate landings for Argentina were &lt;1,000 t prior to 1994, rising to &gt;15,000 t in 2001 and 17,465 t in 2003 (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2002, Massa <em>et al.</em> 2004a, b). Skates are exploited over much of the Argentinean continental shelf (i.e., see Figure 4 in García de la Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/> <br/>In the directed <em>Z. chilensis</em> fishery, onboard observation showed that in 2000 and 2001, the single longline vessel fished from 37° to 44°S off Argentina in two regions; around 50 m of depth and along the 100 m isobath (Colonello<em> et al.</em> 2002). <em>Zearaja chilensis</em> accounted for ~50%+ of the catch of skates both in the shallower and deeper fished areas (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/> <br/><em>Zearaja chilensis</em> is a bycatch (often retained) in several multispecies demersal fisheries which operate within its Southwest Atlantic range, however, species-specific catch data are generally unavailable. For example, it is a bycatch of benthic trawl fisheries for Argentine hake <em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>, flounder and white croaker (Cousseau <em>et al.</em> 2000, Koen Alonso <em>et al</em>. 2001, Buratti 2004), of the multispecies coastal benthic trawl fishery operating out of Puerto Quequén (Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006), and of the Patagonian red shrimp <em>Pleoticus muelleri</em> fishery (Cedrola <em>et al.</em> 2005). The latter is an industrial fishery which has been operating since 1979, with target catches rising since 1998, and reaching a peak of 79,000 mt in 2001 (Cedrola <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/> <br/>During fishery-independent investigations, García de la Rosa <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a 53% decline in the biomass of <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Z</span><em>. chilensis</em> captured from 45° to 55°S during summer surveying in 1999 compared to 1998. It was acknowledged, however, that during the second phase of the investigations, new gear was employed which likely reduced the capture of rays, and as such these estimates should be viewed with caution.<br/> <br/>Colonello <em>et al.</em> (2002) and García de la Rosa (1998) provide detailed accounts of size distributions and sex ratios of <em>Zearaja chilensis</em> in relation to latitude and depth taken in commercial operations (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2002) and research cruises (García de la Rosa 1998) off Argentina.  <br/> <br/>In Uruguay, this species, along with <em>Sympterygia bonapartei, S. acuta</em> and <em>Atlantoraja castelnaui</em> are the main target species of a bottom longline fishery (Paesch and Domingo 2003). Species-specific catch data are not available, but captures of this group of skates for the period 1999 to 2002 are estimated at ~1,100 tons per year (A. Domingo pers. comm).<br/> <br/><strong>Falkland/Malvinas Islands</strong> <br/>Since 1989, skates have been targeted by a Korean fleet utilizing demersal trawls around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Although approximately 11 skate species are regularly taken, commercial catches are dominated by four species including <em>Z. chilensis</em> (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000, Wakeford <em>et al.</em> 2004). The fishery initially operated over two main areas, one located on the shelf edge to the north of the Islands, and the other to the south of the Islands. Agnew <em>et al.</em> (2000) found that between 1993 and 1996 there was some evidence that <em>Z. chilensis</em> declined in catches (as a proportion of the total catch weight, from 10% in 1993 to 6% in 1996), but in 1997 the proportion increased again. <em>Zearaja chilensis</em> did however, show the greatest decrease in mean and maximum size from 1993 to 1997 of any species. Mean size was 76.76 cm DW in 1993 and 58.49 cm DW in 1997 (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000). Agnew <em>et al.</em> (2000) suggests that this decline in size may not be the result of fishing pressure in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands alone, but a combination of exploitation there and in Argentina where the species is more abundant. Following declines in CPUE in the early 1990s, the southern area was closed to the ray fleet in 1996 and the fishery now concentrates in the northern area. A more recent assessment of the northern ray population, utilizing observer data, has shown an increasing trend in the relative abundance of <em>Z. chilensis</em> in catches, with an increasing trend in CPUE from 1992-1993 to 1999-2001 (Wakeford <em>et al.</em> 2004). The Falkland/Malvinas Islands have in place a precautionary management system for the skate fishery (see Conservation Actions below), and together with the recovery of biomass (Agnew <em>et al. </em>2000), this means that the fishery will continue into the future, because overall stocks are stable or recovering. As such, pressure will continue on all species, including those likely less able to sustain heavy fishing pressure, such as <span style=""""font-style: italic;"""">Z</span><em>. chilensis</em> (inferred from its life history and documented declines in the Southeast Pacific). Furthermore, it should be noted that localised depletions may be masked by overall CPUE trends (Wakeford <em>et al.</em> 2004). There have been no studies to determine the abundance of this species in the southern area since the skate fishery closure. However, this species is also caught as bycatch by finfish trawlers targeting southern blue whiting <em>Micromesistius australis</em>, hoki <em>Macruronus magellanicus</em>, hake <em>Merluccius hubbsi</em> and <em>M. australis</em>, and Patagonian cod <em>Salilota australis</em> around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and within the southern skate closure. While vessels fishing under general finfish licenses are prohibited from targeting skates, a small bycatch (below 10%) is allowed so skates to the south of the Islands are continuing to face bycatch fishing pressure (J. Pompert pers. comm).","<strong>Chile</strong>
<br/>In Chile, catches are regulated by annual total quota. Following Lamilla <em>et al.</em> (2001, 2002), in the fishing grounds between 39°15' and 41°28.6'S, quotas were set at 600 t for 2002, 500 t for 2003. Afterwards, quotas have been 425 t for 2004, 400 t for 2005 and 370 t for 2006. Since 2005, there has also been an annual quota for <em>Dipturus</em> spp. south of 41°28.6'S of 2,000 t for that year and 1,430 t for 2006. Each year, there is also a seasonal fishery closure for the entire Chilean coast between December 1 and February 28 to protect the reproductive season. Regulations and management tools utilised need to be species-specific, due to differing life histories and abundance patterns of <em>Dipturus trachydermus</em> and <em>Zearaja chilensis.</em>
<br/>
<br/><strong>Argentina</strong>
<br/>In Argentina, the assessment of direct and indirect catches is a priority. There are theoretically TACs, minimum sizes and overall annual quotas for quite a number of elasmobranch species in Argentina, however, little attention is paid to these and there is no regular monitoring by authorities (M. Stehmann pers. comm).  
<br/>
<br/><strong>Falkland/Malvinas Islands</strong> 
<br/>The following information is taken from Agnew <em>et al.</em> (1999, 2000) unless otherwise specified.  The Falkland/Malvinas Islands multispecies skate fishery is managed by limiting fishing effort. The effort that each vessel is likely to exert is calculated (based on size, duration of license and past fishing history) and since 1994 only a limited number of licenses are granted to ensure that the total allowable effort (determined from assessments of stock status) is not exceeded. Stock status assessments are not, however, species-specific and a sustainable total allowable effort for the entire stock may not translate to sustainable levels of effort for individual species. Following declines in CPUE in the early 1990s, in 1996, the southern area (south of 52°S) was closed to skate fishing and the fishery is now restricted to the area north of the Islands. This closure is extended to 50°30' S (between 56°30W and 58°W) during the second season of each year to exclude the skate fishing fleet from Loligo gahi fishing grounds. All licensed vessels are required to provide daily catch and effort details, including discards of commercial and non-commercial species to the Falkland Island Fisheries Department. There is, however, no requirement to report species-specific information. Scientific observers are deployed onboard skate vessels in order to quantify the catch composition by species and to obtain detailed biological data on individual species. Vessels fishing under general finfish licenses are prohibited from targeting skates, although a small bycatch (below 10%) is allowed.",Decreasing,"Reportedly one of the most abundant skate species of the Southwest Atlantic, however exact details of population size are unknown.
<br/>
<br/>Wakeford <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggests that the species does not form a resident population in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, but has a broad distribution in the Southwest Atlantic. As such, exploitation off Patagonian Argentina may be impacting upon the abundance and population structure of the species around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000). Few small individuals of <em>Zearaja chilensis</em> are found around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and the seasonal movement of the species westward out of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands region towards the end of the year is suggested by Wakeford <em>et al.</em> (2004).",Marine,yes,Chondrichthyan,spp_th
