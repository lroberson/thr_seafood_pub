## Summary

Here I explore the RAM stock legacy database as a possible list/indicator of whether a species is "commercially targeted"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

## Search for matches in th spp catch list 

Downloaded from: https://zenodo.org/record/3676088#.Xp0WbVMzZPM
version 4.491

Stock list was created by selecting species names listed in version 4.491 of the RAM database

```{match thr catch list}

## load RAM stock list

stock_list <- read_csv("_data/ram_stock_list.csv")
names(stock_list)

#<><><><>
## catch commodities

catch_list <- read_csv("_results/thr_catch_spp_summ.csv")

names(catch_list)
n_distinct(catch_list$taxon_sciname) # n = 91, cod excluded

## match with ram stock list by full scientific name

ram_full_matches <- left_join(catch_list, stock_list, by = c("taxon_sciname" = "scientificname")) %>%
  rename(ram_commonname = commonname)

## Keep only full name matches 
write_csv(ram_full_matches, "_results/ram_full_matches.csv")

## add binary col to thr catch list 

catch_list <- left_join(catch_list, stock_list, by = c("taxon_sciname" = "scientificname")) %>%
  rename(ram_commonname = commonname) %>%
  mutate(ram_yn = ifelse(!is.na(ram_commonname), "y", "n")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(ram_commonname, stockid, taxGroup))

## save
write_csv(catch_list, "_data/thr_catch_spp_plotdat.csv")

```

## Total catch volume of "targeted" species 

```{total catch vol targeted spp}

## RAM listed species
catch_list <- read_csv("_data/th_spp_plotdat.csv")

names(catch_list)
nrow(catch_list) # n = 91, cod excluded here

catch_list %>% summarise(tot = sum(catch_spp_tot)) 

catch_list %>%
  filter(ram_yn == "y") %>%
  summarise(tot = sum(catch_spp_tot)) 

ram_list <- catch_list %>% filter(ram_yn == "y") %>% select(taxon_sciname)

nrow(ram_list) 


## compare RAM listed spp to rl threats results

rl_threats <- read_csv("_results/tables/spp_threatcodes_summ.csv")

head(rl_threats)

# get species with threat code 1 (intentional large scale fishing)
iucn_list <- rl_threats %>% 
  mutate(first = stri_extract_first(threat_codes, regex = "\\d{1}")) %>% # extract first digit
  filter(first == 1)

iucn_only <- anti_join(iucn_list, ram_list, by = c("friendly_name" = "taxon_sciname")) %>%
  select(friendly_name) %>%
  rename(taxon_sciname = friendly_name)

## get catch proportion of all these species 

full_list <- bind_rows(ram_list, iucn_only)

full_vec <- full_list %>% pull(taxon_sciname)

length(full_vec) # n = 73

catch_list %>%
  filter(taxon_sciname %in% full_vec | 
           taxon_sciname %in% c("Merluccius senegalensis", "Kajikia albida", "Epinephelus striatus", "Apostichopus japonicus")) %>% # also the 4 species not in RAM but traded internationally
  summarise(n_spp = n_distinct(taxon_sciname), # n = 73 -> imported spp are in the iucn list
              tot = sum(catch_spp_tot)) 

catch_list %>% summarise(tot = sum(usd_spp_tot)) 


```
